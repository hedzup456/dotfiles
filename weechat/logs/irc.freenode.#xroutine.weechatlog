2017-12-11 14:30:30	FlibberTGibbet	my office is in the garage, so working from home is a 10 second trip... :)
2017-12-11 14:31:03	C3D2	What is it you do?
2017-12-11 14:32:28	FlibberTGibbet	mostly ship VDR data extractions at the moment. bit of web/publishing stuff and some light sysadmin duties.
2017-12-11 14:32:37	FlibberTGibbet	and you?
2017-12-11 14:33:31	C3D2	I'm stuck on helldesk

2017-12-11 14:34:14	C3D2	Windows mostly, all sorts of applications
2017-12-11 14:34:28	C3D2	It's for an msp, so it's basically "support it regardless"
2017-12-11 14:34:51	FlibberTGibbet	ah, Windows. just gave me a pleasant morning watching updates, restarts and 'please wait' screens. mostly the latter...
2017-12-11 14:35:01	C3D2	Of course!
2017-12-11 14:35:31	FlibberTGibbet	i know the feeling. i'm 'accidentally the support' for a few major clients on nav software
2017-12-11 14:35:56	C3D2	poor so
2017-12-11 14:35:57	C3D2	sod
2017-12-11 14:36:04	FlibberTGibbet	hopefully won't get woken at 2am to deal with an issue playing out live on a ship, but there's a first time for everything :)
2017-12-11 14:36:24	FlibberTGibbet	mostly i'm just pointing them at a ticketing site, and it's very low traffic.
2017-12-11 14:36:36	C3D2	Offer them a sextant and tell 'em to get on with it
2017-12-11 14:37:06	FlibberTGibbet	lol. if only. think the oil and gas folks will  be after more from me :)
2017-12-11 14:37:37	FlibberTGibbet	though tbh there's nothing in the support agreement to sugget 24/7/365 -- it's more about updates and edits.
2017-12-11 14:37:49	FlibberTGibbet	s/sugget/suggest
2017-12-11 14:38:02	C3D2	I mean if they're really pushy, a couple of paper charts can't be that hard to get a hold of
2017-12-11 14:38:56	FlibberTGibbet	they usually have those as backups anyway -- just provided a few clients with printed sets of charts. but they do rather like the super-expensive dual head gps systems and the piloting software do behave like it says on the tin. so far, so good...
2017-12-11 14:39:28	C3D2	Rewrite the tin!
2017-12-11 14:39:38	FlibberTGibbet	lol! not a bad plan...
2017-12-11 14:40:05	FlibberTGibbet	well chuffed to find my lost soldering iron in the attic yesterday while looking for the Fake Festive Tree
2017-12-11 14:40:20	FlibberTGibbet	plus all sorts of other fun hand tools
2017-12-11 14:40:44	C3D2	Soldering irons are always fun
2017-12-11 14:40:50	C3D2	What else did you find?
2017-12-11 14:41:11	FlibberTGibbet	true. at least this one saves trips to the hackspace 25 miles away just to lash together a simple microphone or whatever
2017-12-11 14:41:27	C3D2	Exactly!
2017-12-11 14:41:55	C3D2	If I'm honest, I should probably get myself a half-decent iron... I'm just lazy.
2017-12-11 14:42:06	FlibberTGibbet	some micro-sized wood planes and marking tools, a wire detector, nice saws, chisels. forgot i had half of it :)
2017-12-11 14:42:37	FlibberTGibbet	my iron is crap compared to the fancy temp-controlled jobs at the hackspace but it's good enough to solder wire x to component y
2017-12-11 14:42:55	C3D2	Guess you got yourself a little treat, then.
2017-12-11 14:43:03	FlibberTGibbet	yup
2017-12-11 14:43:32	C3D2	Ditto, except it takes forever to heat up even a single degree, is heavy and unweildy, and could probably do with a new tip or four.
2017-12-11 14:43:32	FlibberTGibbet	now to find somewhere to assemble stuff. ran out of room in our shoebox house ages ago
2017-12-11 14:44:12	FlibberTGibbet	good point, haven't tested mine yet.
2017-12-11 14:44:26	FlibberTGibbet	be back in a bit -- school run :/
