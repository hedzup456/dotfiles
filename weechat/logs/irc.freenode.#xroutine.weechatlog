2017-12-11 14:31:03	C3D2	What is it you do?
2017-12-11 14:32:28	FlibberTGibbet	mostly ship VDR data extractions at the moment. bit of web/publishing stuff and some light sysadmin duties.
2017-12-11 14:32:37	FlibberTGibbet	and you?
2017-12-11 14:33:31	C3D2	I'm stuck on helldesk

2017-12-11 14:34:28	C3D2	It's for an msp, so it's basically "support it regardless"
2017-12-11 14:34:51	FlibberTGibbet	ah, Windows. just gave me a pleasant morning watching updates, restarts and 'please wait' screens. mostly the latter...
2017-12-11 14:35:01	C3D2	Of course!
2017-12-11 14:35:31	FlibberTGibbet	i know the feeling. i'm 'accidentally the support' for a few major clients on nav software
2017-12-11 14:35:56	C3D2	poor so
2017-12-11 14:35:57	C3D2	sod
2017-12-11 14:36:04	FlibberTGibbet	hopefully won't get woken at 2am to deal with an issue playing out live on a ship, but there's a first time for everything :)
2017-12-11 14:36:24	FlibberTGibbet	mostly i'm just pointing them at a ticketing site, and it's very low traffic.
2017-12-11 14:36:36	C3D2	Offer them a sextant and tell 'em to get on with it
2017-12-11 14:37:06	FlibberTGibbet	lol. if only. think the oil and gas folks will  be after more from me :)
2017-12-11 14:37:37	FlibberTGibbet	though tbh there's nothing in the support agreement to sugget 24/7/365 -- it's more about updates and edits.
2017-12-11 14:37:49	FlibberTGibbet	s/sugget/suggest
2017-12-11 14:38:02	C3D2	I mean if they're really pushy, a couple of paper charts can't be that hard to get a hold of
2017-12-11 14:38:56	FlibberTGibbet	they usually have those as backups anyway -- just provided a few clients with printed sets of charts. but they do rather like the super-expensive dual head gps systems and the piloting software do behave like it says on the tin. so far, so good...
2017-12-11 14:39:28	C3D2	Rewrite the tin!
2017-12-11 14:39:38	FlibberTGibbet	lol! not a bad plan...
2017-12-11 14:40:05	FlibberTGibbet	well chuffed to find my lost soldering iron in the attic yesterday while looking for the Fake Festive Tree
2017-12-11 14:40:20	FlibberTGibbet	plus all sorts of other fun hand tools
2017-12-11 14:40:44	C3D2	Soldering irons are always fun
2017-12-11 14:40:50	C3D2	What else did you find?
2017-12-11 14:41:11	FlibberTGibbet	true. at least this one saves trips to the hackspace 25 miles away just to lash together a simple microphone or whatever
2017-12-11 14:41:27	C3D2	Exactly!
2017-12-11 14:41:55	C3D2	If I'm honest, I should probably get myself a half-decent iron... I'm just lazy.
2017-12-11 14:42:06	FlibberTGibbet	some micro-sized wood planes and marking tools, a wire detector, nice saws, chisels. forgot i had half of it :)
2017-12-11 14:42:37	FlibberTGibbet	my iron is crap compared to the fancy temp-controlled jobs at the hackspace but it's good enough to solder wire x to component y
2017-12-11 14:42:55	C3D2	Guess you got yourself a little treat, then.
2017-12-11 14:43:03	FlibberTGibbet	yup
2017-12-11 14:43:32	C3D2	Ditto, except it takes forever to heat up even a single degree, is heavy and unweildy, and could probably do with a new tip or four.
2017-12-11 14:43:32	FlibberTGibbet	now to find somewhere to assemble stuff. ran out of room in our shoebox house ages ago
2017-12-11 14:44:12	FlibberTGibbet	good point, haven't tested mine yet.
2017-12-11 14:44:26	FlibberTGibbet	be back in a bit -- school run :/

2017-12-13 17:07:49	d3r1ck	pekka10: :D
2017-12-13 17:07:51	FlibberTGibbet	good grief. just tried hyper (https://hyper.is). some crazy people have designed a standalone javascript terminal emulator. which doesn't work very well. no wonder we haven't colonised the planets yet...
2017-12-13 17:08:08	d3r1ck	I didn't know Qt had a LTS even though I gon't use it much :)
2017-12-13 17:08:27	FlibberTGibbet	had to look it up d3r1ck -- right near the mountain?
2017-12-13 17:08:47	d3r1ck	Yes, exactly!
2017-12-13 17:08:58	pekka10	FlibberTGibbet: we have colomized the mountains?
2017-12-13 17:09:08	d3r1ck	Nope! You haven't
2017-12-13 17:09:58	FlibberTGibbet	pekka10: nope. i mentioned colonising the planets in the sense that "brains wasted on npm projects could be doing better things" but am not a colonialist myself...
2017-12-13 17:10:43	pekka10	maybe it was just a "proof of concept" project
2017-12-13 17:11:01	FlibberTGibbet	didn't realise that Mount Cameroon is an active volcano...
2017-12-13 17:11:28	FlibberTGibbet	pekka10, it certainly proves that there are better ideas than reinventing every last wheel in javascript :)
2017-12-13 17:13:16	FlibberTGibbet	looks rather nice there d3r1ck

2017-12-13 17:16:47	FlibberTGibbet	but generally ok. i'd prefer to move somewhere warmer though
2017-12-13 17:17:39	d3r1ck	Ohhh, you can get a heater?
2017-12-13 17:17:52	C3D2	Not for outside!

2017-12-14 15:56:49	FlibberTGibbet	ah, you can specify the coordinate reference system of your choice (presumably to be interpreted properly by applications) but the default is WGS84
2017-12-14 15:57:24	FlibberTGibbet	geniack_ is that boost as in the c++ libraries?
2017-12-14 16:03:00		[15:57]
2017-12-14 16:11:42	geniack_	FlibberTGibbet: yeah
2017-12-14 16:11:49	FlibberTGibbet	ah, ok
2017-12-14 16:11:51	geniack_	i've just run into c++ templating issues
2017-12-14 16:11:54	FlibberTGibbet	way over my head then :)
2017-12-14 16:11:55	geniack_	you have knowledge?
2017-12-14 16:12:04	geniack_	oh well
2017-12-14 16:12:06	geniack_	too bad
2017-12-14 16:12:06	FlibberTGibbet	not if it involves a language with pointers :(
2017-12-14 16:12:32	geniack_	i just figured i cannot use dynamically initialized arrays as a template argument in c++
2017-12-14 16:14:34	FlibberTGibbet	oof :)
2017-12-14 16:15:08	FlibberTGibbet	have to go -- shopping for dottir's birthday party then off to hackspace. good luck with the boost libs

2017-12-18 18:13:13	blowfist	how are you doing?
2017-12-18 18:13:51	FlibberTGibbet	hey blowfist. doing fine thanks. all recovering from the lovely weekend virus :)
2017-12-18 18:13:59	FlibberTGibbet	how are you?
2017-12-18 18:19:00		[18:13]
2017-12-18 18:21:42	blowfist	ouch :(
2017-12-18 18:21:54	blowfist	preparing for your trip to Greece I presume? ;P
2017-12-18 18:22:02	blowfist	I'm ok, thanks :)
2017-12-18 18:22:59	FlibberTGibbet	stuck indoors for the childcare while she's off sick. i'm turning into mary poppins :)
2017-12-18 18:23:05	FlibberTGibbet	but yes, starting to pack etc tomorrow
2017-12-18 18:23:41	blowfist	I envy you ^^
2017-12-18 18:24:35	blowfist	this weekend, we've been busy installing electric heaters in my country house
2017-12-18 18:24:48	blowfist	we had a central heating system that used oil as fuel
2017-12-18 18:25:04	FlibberTGibbet	ah, it'll have its downsides as usual. i'll be in touch while i'm over there (possibly via vpn from my uk isp!)
2017-12-18 18:25:27	blowfist	why do you need a vpn though?
2017-12-18 18:25:34	blowfist	the ports are blocked?
2017-12-18 18:25:49	blowfist	or you mean an ssh tunnel?
2017-12-18 18:26:16	FlibberTGibbet	more of an ssh tunnel. though my asus router basically acts as a vpn server, so it says at least
2017-12-18 18:26:29	FlibberTGibbet	that's how i got around the entirely unsecured wifi in that french hotel
2017-12-18 18:26:43	blowfist	but you have a dynamic IP?
2017-12-18 18:26:46	FlibberTGibbet	static
2017-12-18 18:26:51	FlibberTGibbet	in the uk anyway
2017-12-18 18:26:58	blowfist	ah that's easier then :)
2017-12-18 18:27:01	FlibberTGibbet	yup
2017-12-18 18:27:20	FlibberTGibbet	my isp is basically a b2b provider that also supplies homeworking freelancers
2017-12-18 18:27:33	FlibberTGibbet	so it is much more business oriented than the average domestic isp
2017-12-18 18:27:58	FlibberTGibbet	bloody expensive but no contention, throttling, traffic monitorying/shaping
2017-12-18 18:31:39	blowfist	do you get ipv6 too?
2017-12-18 18:32:04	FlibberTGibbet	yes, though configuring ipv6 has thus far been beyond my limited IQ :)
2017-12-18 18:32:12	blowfist	last time I had an issue getting TLS certificates for some of my domain names
2017-12-18 18:32:29	blowfist	the challenges just wouldn't work anymore for some weird reasons
2017-12-18 18:32:30	FlibberTGibbet	tls including ipv6 addresses?
2017-12-18 18:32:34	FlibberTGibbet	ah
2017-12-18 18:32:48	FlibberTGibbet	buying certs or using letsencrypt?
2017-12-18 18:33:26	blowfist	turns out the dns was set to send the ipv4 address and it also sent an ipv6 address and letsencrypt decided to treat ipv6 in priority exclusively, so it failed miserably... had to remove the ipv6 configuration for it to work
2017-12-18 18:33:44	blowfist	with letsencrypt, it's totally free :)
2017-12-18 18:34:13	blowfist	I have no clue why it worked before
2017-12-18 18:34:13		[18:34]
2017-12-18 18:35:04	blowfist	so ipv6 can get annoying sometimes ;P
2017-12-18 18:37:30	blowfist	ipv6 creeps me out a bit... especially the firewall configuration, I've never done anything other than nat and without it I feel naked ahah
2017-12-18 18:40:39	FlibberTGibbet	i need to do an actual course on it. like with study materials and a virtual network environment to play with... otherwise i'll never get my head around it

2017-12-18 18:54:11	blowfist	ah it's in french ;P
2017-12-18 18:55:26	blowfist	I remember when I played a rogue like game and I found a weapon called "main gauche", I was wondering what the heck this weapon could be like and it sounded like weird english
2017-12-18 18:55:44	blowfist	when I started to do some research on it, it hit me that it was in fact in french -_-
2017-12-18 18:55:53	blowfist	I felt silly lol
2017-12-18 18:58:11	blowfist	oh april 20th
2017-12-18 19:03:13	blowfist	it looks really cool, I definitely have to put that on my agenda
2017-12-18 19:09:00		[19:03]
2017-12-18 19:38:23	FlibberTGibbet	main gauche is a loan term taken from French for the smaller knife/sword held in the left hand :)
2017-12-18 19:38:23		[19:38]
2017-12-18 19:39:53	blowfist	that explains my failure to play correctly then, I thought it was a main weapon, turns out I only had a dagger ;P
2017-12-18 19:40:04	FlibberTGibbet	the principal guards/positions are also from French: prime, seconde, tierce, quarte, quinte and so on
2017-12-18 19:40:10	FlibberTGibbet	heh
2017-12-18 19:40:31	FlibberTGibbet	it's a secondary line of defence (and offence once you're inside the oppenent's reach)

2017-12-20 17:23:21	d3r1ck	Let me give it a try
2017-12-20 17:23:58	d3r1ck	I'm using Python 3.6 :)
2017-12-20 17:24:45	blowfist	that will work perfectly then
2017-12-20 17:25:38	blowfist	the only thing I don't understand is why it can't be killed while running... SIGINT doesn't work
2017-12-20 17:26:55	d3r1ck	blowfist: Just tested it :)
2017-12-20 17:26:57	d3r1ck	Great!
2017-12-20 17:27:04	d3r1ck	Let me look at the code now
2017-12-20 17:27:04		[17:27]
2017-12-20 17:27:16	blowfist	at what speed did you manage to write it? :)
2017-12-20 17:27:57	blowfist	I just typed it (at bit slow) and got 107 WPM
2017-12-20 17:29:47	d3r1ck	89.XXXX
2017-12-20 17:29:52	d3r1ck	:D
2017-12-20 17:30:05	d3r1ck	Since it's my first time and needed to read the string :D
2017-12-20 17:30:18	blowfist	that's very good
2017-12-20 17:30:29	blowfist	do you do touch typing?
2017-12-20 17:34:19	blowfist	this string is special btw, it's made to contain all the letters of the alphabet
2017-12-20 17:34:42	blowfist	so it is significant
2017-12-20 17:35:39	d3r1ck	:D
2017-12-20 17:35:53	d3r1ck	Trying to look at your code and see why Ctrl + C now working
2017-12-20 17:35:55	d3r1ck	Maybe fix it
2017-12-20 17:36:04	d3r1ck	Second time was 120WPM
2017-12-20 17:37:33	blowfist	heh you type faster than me!
2017-12-20 17:38:35	blowfist	I didn't put anything in my code to catch any signal
2017-12-20 17:38:43	blowfist	it seems to be a python3 thing

2017-12-20 17:42:17	blowfist	so how can I fix this?
2017-12-20 17:42:17		[17:42]
2017-12-20 17:42:30	blowfist	can I make it poll for signals?
2017-12-20 17:42:53	blowfist	because SIGINT is sent by the kernel, it's not the actual strokes that are sent to the program
2017-12-20 17:43:53	blowfist	and I'm using blocky input...
2017-12-20 17:44:01	blowfist	this sucks heh
2017-12-20 17:44:16	blowfist	maybe I should catch ctrl + c ... but...
2017-12-20 17:44:23	blowfist	that is the worst bug ever

2017-12-20 17:45:22	d3r1ck	Have you tried Ctrl+Break?
2017-12-20 17:45:51	blowfist	I have an apple keyboard, I don't know where the breaks are ;P
2017-12-20 17:46:03	d3r1ck	Or use 'try ... except"
2017-12-20 17:46:06	d3r1ck	In the code?
2017-12-20 17:46:48	blowfist	hmm
2017-12-20 17:47:32	blowfist	it's unfortunate because I really like to use the function map
2017-12-20 17:47:36	blowfist	and keep it simple
2017-12-20 17:47:55	d3r1ck	I'm trying something now
2017-12-20 17:47:58	d3r1ck	Will tell you if it works
2017-12-20 17:48:16	blowfist	the only method I can think of is to use a global and I try to avoid using globals like the plague
