2017-12-07 20:33:50	@_alex_w_	the old recommendation was 64x, i think it changed to 72x so that 64x is still untapered

2017-12-07 20:38:39	C3D2	lucky git, I can't
2017-12-07 20:38:54	@_alex_w_	if you find old samson instructions (i can't quickly find them online) they do 3 fid bury lengths, a fid is 21 diameters, so it was 63x

2017-12-07 20:39:04	@_alex_w_	now they say 3.5 which is 73.5x

2017-12-07 20:40:18	Essington	I can remember diameters
2017-12-07 20:40:42	@_alex_w_	and i do a mix of brummel vs simple bury (to takl about theo ther parts of that blog page)
2017-12-07 20:40:51	@_alex_w_	sometimes bury is easier/faster when dealing with hardware
2017-12-07 20:41:19	Essington	I always brummel
2017-12-07 20:41:29	Essington	simply for the security of it all
2017-12-07 20:41:44	@_alex_w_	well, sometimes that isn't possible when you have fixed hardware on both sides
2017-12-07 20:42:05	@_alex_w_	like my traveler line (which is control-dpx, same single braid splices) is a simple bury
2017-12-07 20:42:27	@_alex_w_	if i wanted to brummel i'd have to put a soft or hard shackle in there
2017-12-07 20:42:47	Essington	yeah, I guess that is a case ...
2017-12-07 20:43:09	@_alex_w_	same thing with the backstay on my old boat, which had a thimble in one end and a huge low friction ring at the other
2017-12-07 20:43:19	Essington	even my bronze eyes were able to be brummeled on both ends ...
2017-12-07 20:43:44	@_alex_w_	did you make them a hair oversized and slip the eye in after the splice was finished?

2017-12-07 20:44:55	@_alex_w_	yes, that thimble is too large to be passed through the braid, so at one point did you install it into the splice?
2017-12-07 20:45:01	Essington	nah, stuff a couple of pieces of PVC into the loop and twist them ... it inverts the brummel just enough to slip over the thimble, then you relax and bury

2017-12-08 19:08:50	singlerider	I feel like steering is kind of a brainless activity
2017-12-08 19:08:59	singlerider	It's time to outsource!
2017-12-08 19:09:04	@Marcus	:D
2017-12-08 19:09:26	@Marcus	the mount is huge for my boat
2017-12-08 19:09:32	@Marcus	obscures the entire stern
2017-12-08 19:09:39	singlerider	Dude, for mine, it's will be MASSIVE
2017-12-08 19:09:47	singlerider	Marcus: I have a transom hung rudder
2017-12-08 19:09:52	@Marcus	yeah same here
2017-12-08 19:10:02	singlerider	Ah, yeah. you know the struggle

2017-12-08 19:11:17	singlerider	Hehe
2017-12-08 19:11:30	singlerider	Dan-NS27's boat is 9 feet shorted than mine and has all the same stuff
2017-12-08 19:11:34	singlerider	shorter*
2017-12-08 19:12:40	@Marcus	the mount for the windpilot is a lot smaller

2017-12-08 19:12:58	@Marcus	but it looks like a delicate failure point where that the vane connects to the base
2017-12-08 19:13:02	singlerider	Marcus: would you like a picture of the mounting setup drawing for my boat?

2017-12-08 19:16:08	singlerider	Berkeley might be pissed about the length :p
2017-12-08 19:16:53	@Marcus	that system looks a lot more robust
2017-12-08 19:17:08	singlerider	I'm super pumped about finally getting a windvane
2017-12-08 19:17:18	singlerider	I negotiated it in the purchase price
2017-12-08 19:17:22	@Marcus	it's on my must have list
2017-12-08 19:17:28	@Marcus	I don't want to hand steer to teh bahamas
2017-12-08 19:17:39	singlerider	"it" being the windvane, minus the mounting system
2017-12-08 19:18:59	@Marcus	it's a big expense but I imagine you can bring it to your next boat if you want
2017-12-08 19:19:04	@Marcus	and not include it in the sale
2017-12-08 19:19:59	CalebD_	the mounting hardware varies from boat to boat often
2017-12-08 19:20:30	@Marcus	right
2017-12-08 19:20:41	@Marcus	but on my boat, at the high end all fixed up say it's worth... 18
2017-12-08 19:20:43	CalebD_	but the basic guts are the same
2017-12-08 19:21:01	@Marcus	if I have 28 in it because of life raft and self steer, I woujldn't sell the boat for 18 with those items included
2017-12-08 19:21:18	@Marcus	since they can be transferred to another boat, I'd jsut take them off and sell without
2017-12-08 19:22:31	@Marcus	does that make sense?
2017-12-08 19:22:41	@Marcus	I mean, when this boat is done, it's going to have more in it than I can reasonably sell it for
2017-12-08 19:22:55	@Marcus	but if I can remove a couple of high ticket items, then sell it for what it's worth, then I'm okay with that
2017-12-08 19:23:10	@Marcus	i don't plan on selling it, but you never know
2017-12-08 19:23:19	singlerider	Why ever sell?
2017-12-08 19:23:19	CalebD_	yeah, life raft and wind vane could be sold separately
2017-12-08 19:23:24	singlerider	Get something bigger?
2017-12-08 19:23:25	@Marcus	singlerider: bigger boat
2017-12-08 19:23:38	singlerider	Driving my 36 feels overwhelming
2017-12-08 19:23:39	CalebD_	or kept for next boat
2017-12-08 19:23:39	@Marcus	if fortune puts me in a place where I could have an alberg 35 or 37, then I probably would do it
2017-12-08 19:24:01	singlerider	I've piloted a 55 footer and I felt like I was driving an aircraft carrier
2017-12-08 19:24:37	singlerider	Marcus: that's some serious sail area
2017-12-08 19:24:49	singlerider	That boom is gigantic
2017-12-08 19:25:02	@Marcus	which boom?
2017-12-08 19:25:08	singlerider	Alberg 35
2017-12-08 19:25:19	@Marcus	yeah I suppose so
2017-12-08 19:25:32	@Marcus	the boom in my finn is like 11.5' long and the boat is only 14'
2017-12-08 19:25:35	@Marcus	to me it feels normal
2017-12-08 19:25:43	CalebD_	and the shape of the stern of an Alberg 35 is pretty similar to your Marieholm, just bigger
2017-12-08 19:25:45	singlerider	My boom is super short
2017-12-08 19:25:54	@Marcus	the boom in the marieholm is a lot shorter
2017-12-08 19:26:11	CalebD_	just not sure the size wind vane you buy for the Marieholm will be big enough for an Alberg 35
2017-12-08 19:26:23	singlerider	Size wind vane?
2017-12-08 19:26:33	singlerider	I don't think the size of the wind vane matters so much
2017-12-08 19:26:46	CalebD_	idk
2017-12-08 19:26:48	singlerider	As long as it can turn a wheel
2017-12-08 19:27:07	singlerider	(in my case, a wheel)
2017-12-08 19:27:14	@Marcus	doesn't monitor only make one size?
2017-12-08 19:27:21	singlerider	I think so
2017-12-08 19:27:32	singlerider	Well, Monitor is the product, Scanmar is the company
2017-12-08 19:28:25	CalebD_	well if it is one size fits all then you are in luck
2017-12-08 19:28:25		[19:28]
2017-12-08 19:28:43	@Marcus	wind pilot makes several sizes but the size for my boat is also the size for an alberg
2017-12-08 19:28:44	CalebD_	unlike with tiller pilots which vary in torque
2017-12-08 19:28:46	@Marcus	so I'd be okay
2017-12-08 19:28:47	singlerider	CalebD_: the mounting hardware changes, as mentioned earlier
2017-12-08 19:29:12	CalebD_	idk windvanes that well
2017-12-08 19:29:59	singlerider	CalebD_: are you familiar with how they operate?
2017-12-08 19:30:07	singlerider	Because it's cool
2017-12-08 19:30:14	CalebD_	conceptually yes
2017-12-08 19:30:39	CalebD_	but no experience using a wind vane

2017-12-08 19:36:43	singlerider	A Monitor can also behave as an emergency rudder!
2017-12-08 19:36:57	@Marcus	don't you have to buy some part that costs like 2 grand for that?
2017-12-08 19:37:13	singlerider	There is another part. I dunno its cost
2017-12-08 19:37:18	singlerider	But the point still stands
2017-12-08 19:37:47	@Marcus	yes
2017-12-08 19:37:56	singlerider	Or I could use it as a Dual Rudder

2017-12-11 16:04:38	singlerider	Like I was in prison and my time was served

2017-12-11 16:13:02	singlerider	Are you both converting your boats into ice breakers?
2017-12-11 16:13:04	C3D2	singlerider: 2 degrees C (little over 35F)
2017-12-11 16:13:16	singlerider	C3D2: I was right. Sounds awful
2017-12-11 16:13:28	Kjango	I spent most of my adult life in Montana & Alaska so this is ok.
2017-12-11 16:13:34	C3D2	could be worse, I was camping Friday night
2017-12-11 16:13:50	C3D2	lows of -3C (26,6F)
2017-12-11 16:13:57	Kjango	Yepper....that would be worse.
2017-12-11 16:14:03	singlerider	Yes, it could be absolute zero
2017-12-11 16:14:13	singlerider	But you could also be in Baja
2017-12-11 16:14:19	singlerider	So it could be better
2017-12-11 16:14:21	C3D2	I may or may not have had a small fire directly under my hammock
2017-12-11 16:14:27	C3D2	It could aways be better

2017-12-11 16:14:50	singlerider	How could it be better than that?
2017-12-11 16:14:58	Kjango	Snowing here this morning......I just put out seeds for the birds.

2017-12-11 16:15:04	C3D2	Yeah, I love waterboarding in the bay!
2017-12-11 16:15:26	C3D2	Snowing very lightly on and off here. Still enough to grind the country to a half
2017-12-11 16:15:33	C3D2	s/half/halt
2017-12-11 16:17:43	Kjango	I was remembering this morning ghosting along at 2-3 knots on a winter day snowing so hard I could only see maybe 50 feet past the bow but it was so calm it was eerily pleasant.
2017-12-11 16:18:40	@Marcus	I've always wanted to sail in the snow
2017-12-11 16:18:52	Kjango	What kind of boats are you guys sailing ???
2017-12-11 16:19:05	@Marcus	I have a Finn, a Snipe, and a Marieholm 261 that I'm rebuilding
2017-12-11 16:19:24	C3D2	Only imaginary ones, currently
2017-12-11 16:19:30	Kjango	I've never done it on purpose Marcus ,  but have got caught a few times.
2017-12-11 16:19:32	C3D2	Woe is me and all that jazz
2017-12-11 16:19:46	Kjango	I feel ya C3.
2017-12-11 16:19:50	@Marcus	Kjango: sometimes it's so peaceful when it's snowing, I just think it would be nice... but cold as shit probably
2017-12-11 16:19:55	@Marcus	and I owuldn't do it in my dinghies
2017-12-11 16:21:16	Kjango	Thats how peaceful I was speaking of Marcus.
2017-12-11 16:21:32	@Marcus	I'm pickin up what you're layin down
2017-12-11 16:22:06	Kjango	The day I was speaking of was on a 40' wood flush deck cutter
2017-12-11 16:22:41	Kjango	I'm sailing a Columbia 9.6 meter these days.
2017-12-11 16:24:08	C3D2	I'm on a Oceanis 37 in May? Does that count?
2017-12-11 16:24:24	Kjango	That way counts C3
2017-12-11 16:24:40	C3D2	Hell yeah
2017-12-11 16:24:49	C3D2	Sadly, I won't own her
2017-12-11 16:25:06	C3D2	Or, for that matter, still be on her at the other end of May :'(
2017-12-11 16:26:05	Kjango	Still it's sailing.

2017-12-11 16:29:47	Kjango	It's helps a bit shopping for gear to take my boat in the Spring.
2017-12-11 16:30:59	C3D2	Kjango: I had a quick look at a map and was like "Oh that's not too bad", then realised that Michigan is roughly the same size as my entire country (and then some)
2017-12-11 16:32:04	Kjango	Yeah.....I'm pretty far away
2017-12-11 16:32:36	C3D2	The scale of the states continues to absolutely blow my mind
2017-12-11 16:33:18	Kjango	I just came back from a vacation on Anna Maria Island in Florida so I shouldn't feel too bad.
2017-12-11 16:33:45	@Marcus	C3D2: you should try driving across them, it's absurd.  You can drive for an entire day and not even be out of texas or california
2017-12-11 16:34:41	C3D2	I'll pass, thanks. The 170-odd miles I drove when looking at unis was bad enough for me, in one block
2017-12-11 16:35:06	C3D2	That said, I do still want to go on a great American road trip..
2017-12-11 16:36:03	Kjango	exactly Marcus.......I was driving once across the Shiprock desert.......Thought I be at Ship Rock in like 20 minutes.......drove like 3 hours & all that happened was the rock kept getting bigger
2017-12-11 16:36:21	@Marcus	yeah the scale of things is ... ridiculous

2017-12-12 15:58:12	singlerider	Today is the day I get my hands on my windvane mount
2017-12-12 15:59:08	@Marcus	is this a self install thing?
2017-12-12 15:59:21	singlerider	Marcus: yeah
2017-12-12 15:59:21	@Marcus	C3D2: where in southwest England?
2017-12-12 15:59:31	@Marcus	singlerider: let me know how it goes
2017-12-12 15:59:35	singlerider	Drilling the transom
2017-12-12 15:59:45	singlerider	I think I'll install it on Sunday
2017-12-12 15:59:49	@Marcus	are you going to put reinforcing plates inside?
2017-12-12 15:59:54	singlerider	I'll get Lnk and elektron to help
2017-12-12 16:00:01	singlerider	Marcus: probably
2017-12-12 16:00:18	singlerider	I won't be able to be there when the mount is picked up
2017-12-12 16:00:28	singlerider	I have a boat guy going on my behalf
2017-12-12 16:00:34	singlerider	He'll make sure I have everything
2017-12-12 16:03:28	_alex_w__	yeah, you'll need backing plates inside the transom
2017-12-12 16:03:49	_alex_w__	but those are easy to make and g10 isnt' that expensive

2017-12-12 16:13:24	@Bill-Rangatira	but g10 can be a pain to cut
2017-12-12 16:13:51	_alex_w__	it cuts like butter with a fine tooth hacksaw
2017-12-12 16:14:41	@Bill-Rangatira	ok i have had trouble cutting it with a hole saw
2017-12-12 16:14:57	@Marcus	cuts fine on my band saw, and with a hole saw too
2017-12-12 16:15:04	@Marcus	try using a sharper blade
2017-12-12 16:15:14	@Marcus	I have to sharpen my hole saws once in a while, fiberglass dulls them pretty quick
2017-12-12 16:15:14	_alex_w__	yeah, i also have no problems with a hole saw, but you need to clear chips often
2017-12-12 16:15:31	_alex_w__	and i also use a bandsaw most of the time, but figured most people didn't have easy access to one at the dock
2017-12-12 16:15:32	@Bill-Rangatira	i found it got hot quickly and gummed up the teeth
2017-12-12 16:15:43	_alex_w__	then your holesaw is dull and chips aren't clearing
2017-12-12 16:15:59	_alex_w__	and once hot it won't work, you need to keep it cool
2017-12-12 16:16:04	_alex_w__	your cutting speed might be too high
2017-12-12 16:16:12	_alex_w__	the heat causes the epoxy to melt instead of cut
2017-12-12 16:16:24	@Bill-Rangatira	i used a water bath and it cut much better
2017-12-12 16:16:39	_alex_w__	i use a hole saw on a milling machine (drill press would be fine too) at like 150rpm
2017-12-12 16:17:39	@Bill-Rangatira	but i was also using a 6" holesaw for backing plates
2017-12-12 16:18:34	_alex_w__	then you need to go ever slower
2017-12-12 16:18:55	_alex_w__	to keep sfm down
2017-12-12 16:20:20	_alex_w__	for my large winch backing plates i just paid for my g10 provider to waterjet the circles that i needed
2017-12-12 16:20:42	_alex_w__	for everything else i cut rectangles on a bandsaw or with a hacksaw and just round over the corners abrasively
2017-12-12 16:22:37	@Marcus	I can run mine pretty fast but my saw is really sharp
2017-12-12 16:23:00	C3D2	Marcus: City 'n' county of Brizzle.

2017-12-12 19:06:12	@Dan-NS27	stopped at a Lowe's, mainly because I needed to go to the bathroom. stop by the table saws and an older guy comes up and starts chatting about his time in the army in the 60's. turns out, he's a Ham and was a radio operator in the army too.
2017-12-12 19:06:30	C3D2	Didya make a friend?
2017-12-12 19:06:53	@Dan-NS27	he said he has or is part of a cyber security company nearby. tried offering me a job, or at least contact them to see if or how I could fit in to their company.

2017-12-12 19:17:43	@Dan-NS27	when he mentioned cyber and asked if I did anything with it, I just said I mess with Linux computers, he said they did too.

2017-12-13 14:07:08	tmbg	you'd think there would be a way to send electricity up a mast for wind widgets by using the mast itself
2017-12-13 14:08:17	C3D2	you'd need at least two conductors, though. Plastic split in the mast doesn't sound especially great for structural integrity
2017-12-13 14:10:41	tmbg	like maybe a loop through a wire between the bottom of the mast, a stay, and then down through the mast to the wire.
2017-12-13 14:11:01	C3D2	I forgot about the stays
2017-12-13 14:11:22	tmbg	the wire between the mast and stay would be inconvenient. but so is climbing a mast to replace a battery

2017-12-13 15:42:13	_alex_w__	they couldn't do that this week at my work, i'd guess that 20% of people are already on vacation
2017-12-13 15:42:18	_alex_w__	by next week it'll be like 40%
2017-12-13 15:42:23	_alex_w__	the following week it'll be 80%
2017-12-13 15:43:37	Marcus_Offsite	I'm surprised they did it this time of year but they want to get the train rolling on jan 2
2017-12-13 15:44:21	_alex_w__	i'm making a minor switch in teams (new boss, same grand boss) so using these couple of weeks to learn some stuff that will be useful on the new team
2017-12-13 15:45:15	Marcus_Offsite	good move?
2017-12-13 15:47:23	_alex_w__	yeah, i think so.  i got moved recently under a new manager, and that wasn't going well
2017-12-13 15:47:33	_alex_w__	this is all happening fairly fast, i haven't told my team yet
2017-12-13 15:47:42	_alex_w__	they'll learn between now and friday
2017-12-13 15:48:13	Marcus_Offsite	when I have a good manager I hate moving, it always screws stuff up
2017-12-13 15:48:21	Marcus_Offsite	at least you had the opportunity to swap
2017-12-13 15:48:38	Marcus_Offsite	I just got a new manager and I can't decide about him yet
2017-12-13 15:49:01	_alex_w__	they made it very clear that they wanted to keep me
2017-12-13 15:49:01		[15:49]
2017-12-13 15:49:12	_alex_w__	when they first told me about the manager change
2017-12-13 15:49:28	_alex_w__	anyway, new job is more infrastructure, less ml, but still interesting stuff
2017-12-13 15:49:43	_alex_w__	new boss is excited to have me on the team
2017-12-13 15:50:01	_alex_w__	it'll be interesting to see how my old team reacts, i think at least a few will want to figure out if they can move with me
2017-12-13 15:51:08	BozS	bbl
2017-12-13 15:51:47	Marcus_Offsite	I probably would too
2017-12-13 15:57:00		[15:51]
2017-12-13 15:58:40	_alex_w__	the new manager of the team has done a pretty awful job of team building.  she never comes to sit in the team's office space, hasn't done any team building events at all, and rarely even comes to our meetings
2017-12-13 15:58:45	_alex_w__	so a lot of people are concerned
2017-12-13 16:01:43	Marcus_Offsite	it feels like thereare 2 schools of thought in tech, new school and old school and sometimes you get an old school manager in a new school organization and it's a really bad fit, wrecks morale
2017-12-13 16:03:07	_alex_w__	she and i are the same age and have similar career backgrounds, so i can't really chalk it up to that.  i can't really theorize why it happened this way, but i'm a lot happier now that i have a path outside of her org
2017-12-13 16:04:09	Marcus_Offsite	I think it depends on their personality and who they've been exposed to more than where they worked
2017-12-13 16:04:17	Marcus_Offsite	I dunno, just a thought
2017-12-13 16:04:19	Marcus_Offsite	glad you're getting out

2017-12-13 16:06:21	Marcus_Offsite	I'm just happy as shit none of that hardware was leaking :)
2017-12-13 16:07:22	_alex_w__	yeah, that's awesome marcus.  is the rub rail easy to fix?
2017-12-13 16:07:33	_alex_w__	i have one leaky handrail still
2017-12-13 16:07:44	_alex_w__	the annoying rebedding is going to be when i redo the inner jib/genoa tracks
2017-12-13 16:08:09	tmbg	C3D2: s+gs?
2017-12-13 16:08:29	_alex_w__	i think there are 25' of tracks in total, 4 bolts per foot, so around 100 bolts
2017-12-13 16:14:00		[16:08]
2017-12-13 16:16:05	Marcus_Offsite	_alex_w__: I was going to replace it anyhow, it's trashed, I'll epoxy the holes up as soon as this snow passes tonight
2017-12-13 16:16:23	Marcus_Offsite	and I think I'm going to use flexiteek instead of real teak for that part
2017-12-13 16:17:04	Marcus_Offsite	I did my jib genoa tracks with butyl and it was pretty easy, went fast, and no leaks
2017-12-13 16:17:55	Marcus_Offsite	get a drill with a socket attachment and it goes fast
2017-12-13 16:18:21	_alex_w__	for both removal and install?
2017-12-13 16:18:26	Marcus_Offsite	yeah
2017-12-13 16:18:30	_alex_w__	i've done removal that way, but always had two people for install
2017-12-13 16:18:35	Marcus_Offsite	wife sat outside with a screwdriver and I was inside with the drill
2017-12-13 16:18:43	_alex_w__	ah, okay same thing
2017-12-13 16:18:46	Marcus_Offsite	yeah
2017-12-13 16:18:51	Marcus_Offsite	by yourself I think it would be impossible
2017-12-13 16:19:21	_alex_w__	i've done a lot of smaller deck hardawre smaller
2017-12-13 16:19:39	_alex_w__	either by making up ways to secure the exterior bolts, or because the hardware was close enough to the companionway for me to reach both
2017-12-13 16:19:59	_alex_w__	and removal almost always works, because the nut is usually less corroded than the top
2017-12-13 16:19:59	Marcus_Offsite	yeah for some of the tracks I didn't have the windows in  yet so I just reached out and did both
2017-12-13 16:20:06	@Dan-NS27	Been awhile since I was on SN, I went to check and was no longer logged in.
2017-12-13 16:20:12	Marcus_Offsite	but otherwise wife was holding the screwdriver
2017-12-13 16:20:22	_alex_w__	yeah, i did all of the tracks on my old boat with two people
2017-12-13 16:20:38	_alex_w__	it was a good chunk of a weekend since we also potted all holes with epoxy
2017-12-13 16:20:53	_alex_w__	this boat has twice as much track, so i figured it'll take close to twice as long
2017-12-13 16:21:10	_alex_w__	at least the traveler on this boat goes through uncored deck
2017-12-13 16:21:10	Marcus_Offsite	yeah that would eat up a lot of time, my decks are not cored in that area so I didn't have to do the holes up that way
2017-12-13 16:21:24	_alex_w__	my outer tracks aren't in core, but the inner tracks are
2017-12-13 16:21:42	_alex_w__	and the starboard jib track has a bit of delam
2017-12-13 16:21:56	Marcus_Offsite	ah that's going to be some work
2017-12-13 16:22:03	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/RejQuest-Express-37/i-zGTkMHB/A
2017-12-13 16:22:07	_alex_w__	you can see the tracks in that photo
2017-12-13 16:22:20	_alex_w__	the starboard jib delam isn't that bad, but it should be handled at some point
2017-12-13 16:22:29	_alex_w__	those outer tracks are along the hull/deck joint, and there is no core there
2017-12-13 16:22:43	_alex_w__	they also don't leak from what i've seen, so not much incentive to worry about them
2017-12-13 16:23:11	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/RejQuest-Express-37/i-64n3Mqr
2017-12-13 16:23:24	_alex_w__	i've rebedded all of the hardware in that photo solo, including the handrails
2017-12-13 16:23:27	Marcus_Offsite	that's how my tracks are set up too
2017-12-13 16:23:46	_alex_w__	and the stacked deck organizers
2017-12-13 16:23:53	Marcus_Offsite	I need new rope clutches too
2017-12-13 16:23:59	Marcus_Offsite	the ones that came on the boat are rope eaters
2017-12-13 16:25:44	Marcus_Offsite	saw yoursand it made me think ofthat
2017-12-13 16:28:19	ziper	what is the relationship of winch diameter to power
2017-12-13 16:30:50	Marcus_Offsite	there's a formula but I don't have it handy
2017-12-13 16:30:50		[16:30]
2017-12-13 16:35:50	C3D2	tmbg: shits and giggles
2017-12-13 16:36:31	tmbg	oh duh
2017-12-13 16:36:54	tmbg	you'd think a manufacturer would have offered that as an option, but I've never seen it
2017-12-13 16:37:12	C3D2	probably a cost v effort v market thing
2017-12-13 16:43:00		[16:37]
2017-12-13 16:43:25	_alex_w__	ziper: winch diameter is increased to add more friction to each wrap to give better control over release
2017-12-13 16:43:36	_alex_w__	diameter increases reduce power, power is controlled by gearing
2017-12-13 16:43:50	ziper	ok, thats kind of what i was thinking

2017-12-13 16:44:44	_alex_w__	on ungeared winches the radius of the winch divided by the handle (usually 10") is the power, but that only works for tiny winches (like a #7)
2017-12-13 16:46:00	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/RejQuest-Express-37/i-P5rTpBg
2017-12-13 16:46:05	_alex_w__	those huge winches are 60 power
2017-12-13 16:46:07	_alex_w__	3 speed
2017-12-13 16:46:09	_alex_w__	lots of gearing
2017-12-13 16:46:46	_alex_w__	and they take me about 30-40 minutes to fully disassemble and assemble compared to 10 minutes for a standard 2sp lewmar
2017-12-13 16:47:14	ziper	thats what made me think about it
2017-12-13 16:47:39	ziper	in the old days did they just use extra long handles
2017-12-13 16:48:07	_alex_w__	they used small sails, and multiperson winches (look at square riggers)
2017-12-13 16:48:46	_alex_w__	and didn't use huge overlapping jibs
2017-12-13 16:49:56	_alex_w__	and they don't again, now big overlapping jibs are pretty rare on new boats
2017-12-13 16:50:37	ziper	i was crewing on a 40 ft cat and the captain kept using the winches with only 2 wraps
2017-12-13 16:51:24	_alex_w__	in how much wind?  and how much upwind sailing?
2017-12-13 16:51:48	_alex_w__	if the sheets weren't slipping then that was probably okay
2017-12-13 16:52:04	ziper	I thought it would be tough on the self-tailers
2017-12-13 16:52:15	ziper	15 kn, close hauled
2017-12-13 16:52:36	_alex_w__	that is tough on the self tailers, but you could tell that if when you eased the sheet it ran really fast
2017-12-13 16:52:42	_alex_w__	the self tailers shouldn't be holding that much load
2017-12-13 16:55:32	ziper	how do winches with more than 2 gears work, I can only find one video and it doesnt explain it
2017-12-13 16:57:09	_alex_w__	on mine you press a button in the center of the winch drum down to go into the highest gear
2017-12-13 16:57:28	_alex_w__	when you switch directions the button automatically pops up and you are now in 2nd gear
2017-12-13 16:57:37	_alex_w__	switch directions again and you are in 1st gear
2017-12-13 16:58:01	_alex_w__	other ones that i've used do this with a little toggle switch on the base to engage 3rd gear
2017-12-13 16:58:01		[16:58]
2017-12-13 16:59:27	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/RejQuest-Express-37/i-7nZrcz5/A
2017-12-13 17:00:10	_alex_w__	do you see how the area around the handle socket is depressed?  that winch is in 3rd gear.  when it is in 1st/2nd gear that pops back up to be flush with the stripper body
2017-12-13 17:00:51	ziper	neat, thanks
2017-12-13 17:04:21	_alex_w__	some of my trimmers use 3rd gear, some don't.  if you time everything right you can leave the sheet in the self tailer the whole time and avoid bringing it across hand over hand
2017-12-13 17:04:40	_alex_w__	the pontos winches have a 4th speed that is accelerated that does that even better.  but it looks like pontos is already out of business
2017-12-13 17:06:48	ziper	what do you mean accelerated
2017-12-13 17:07:52	_alex_w__	drum turns faster than winch handle speed
2017-12-13 17:08:13	_alex_w__	they also do the shifts automatically based on load
2017-12-13 17:08:25	_alex_w__	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Y0X80wBFCM
2017-12-13 17:10:55	ziper	more like gear zero then
2017-12-13 17:11:39	_alex_w__	i'd like to try them on a boat sometime, they seem cool.  i've played with them in person, fisheries supply has a similar display setup to what is shown in that video
2017-12-13 17:11:59	_alex_w__	but having the company maybe close after just 4 years isn't good for parts availability
2017-12-13 17:13:47	Lnk	12:11 < _alex_w__> they also do the shifts automatically based on load
2017-12-13 17:13:47		[17:13]
2017-12-13 17:13:59	Lnk	seems like that'd be a lot to go wrong/break
2017-12-13 17:15:24	_alex_w__	i think it is a pretty simple arrangement, but i've only watched the rebuild videos and haven't seen the internals myself
2017-12-13 17:15:36	_alex_w__	they also have really small drums for their power, which seems concerning
2017-12-13 17:18:40	_alex_w__	http://pontos-americas.com/sites/default/files/docs/NO-015%20%28Ind%20A%29%20Maintenance%20Manual%20Trimmer%2052%20GBR.pdf
2017-12-13 17:19:05	_alex_w__	that shows the overhaul procedure.  the main concerning thing to me is that the stem top screws are very small and seem like they'd easily get clogged
2017-12-13 17:20:30	_alex_w__	from the photos i don't understand how the gear adjusts based on load
2017-12-13 17:24:52	ziper	i wish i had a cnc machine
2017-12-13 17:29:45	_alex_w__	what do you want to make?

2017-12-13 17:39:21	_alex_w__	that isn't so bad if the annoyances of a mill/drill don't get in your way

2017-12-13 17:42:23	_alex_w__	that is a little overpriced, but in the ballpark
2017-12-13 17:42:31	_alex_w__	too bad it has a mt3 headstock taper
2017-12-13 17:42:43	_alex_w__	would be nice to fit >1" material through the spindle
2017-12-13 17:48:00		[17:42]
2017-12-13 17:48:09	Marcus_Offsite	that mill drill isn't horrible but not great
2017-12-13 17:48:16	Marcus_Offsite	considering I can buy a g0704 for 1200
2017-12-13 17:48:29	Marcus_Offsite	not sure how rigid it would be
2017-12-13 17:49:26	Marcus_Offsite	a lot of the stuff for sale locally is hella tired too
2017-12-13 17:50:22	Marcus_Offsite	and with the 25% off coupon this is actually cheaper

2017-12-13 17:50:26	Marcus_Offsite	and it's the same machine
2017-12-13 17:52:32	Marcus_Offsite	but yeah all the stuff here is ridiculously expensive, I think because denver is a relatively new town and doesn't have a big industrial base like some other areas
2017-12-13 17:52:34	<--	revoltingPeasant (~joe@unaffiliated/th3-g0d5) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2017-12-13 17:52:39	Marcus_Offsite	so there's not that pool of used machiness
2017-12-13 17:57:24		[C3D2 away: Commute..]
2017-12-13 18:03:00		[17:57]
2017-12-13 18:09:29	_alex_w__	the mill-drill will be a lot more rigid than the g0704, the downside is that the quill extension is short and the head will rotate around the column when you raise or lower it
2017-12-13 18:09:58	_alex_w__	the harbor freight machines are rarely the same, they are clones made in the same country (or moving manufacturing from taiwan to china) at lower quality
2017-12-13 18:10:40	_alex_w__	i've looked at delta (taiwan) vs grizzly (china) vs hf (china) 4x6 bandsaws and the differences are there
2017-12-13 18:14:48	Marcus_Offsite	HF has gotten better with it's stuff, not sure if it's the same, but similar I guess
2017-12-13 18:16:58	Marcus_Offsite	right now though all the expendable cash is flowing to the boat, so maybe in a year or so I could look for a mill
2017-12-13 18:17:25	_alex_w__	it's not the same, but it might be better.  it's a clone of a clone
2017-12-13 18:17:46	Marcus_Offsite	I doubt it's better :)
2017-12-13 18:17:57	_alex_w__	sorry, better than they've been in teh past
2017-12-13 18:18:03	_alex_w__	it won't be better than a taiwanese import
2017-12-13 18:18:03		[18:18]
2017-12-13 18:18:09	Marcus_Offsite	oh, yeah, based on things I've bought I think they're getting better
2017-12-13 18:18:16	Marcus_Offsite	but grizzly is a lot better than hf
2017-12-13 18:18:21	_alex_w__	castings will be worse, bearings will be worse
2017-12-13 18:19:10	_alex_w__	motor is probably worse, but i replace those anyway with a 3phase so that you can run a vfd
2017-12-13 18:19:53	_alex_w__	finding good tools is like finding good boats, they come up when you stop looking
2017-12-13 18:20:22	Marcus_Offsite	I might go over the the tinker mill here, they have a couple of mills, it'd let me see what I like
2017-12-13 18:21:42	_alex_w__	yeah, good idea
2017-12-13 18:21:55	_alex_w__	i always do it the expensive way.  buy a small machine, figure out what drives me nuts, then upgrade
2017-12-13 18:22:03	Marcus_Offsite	yeah I do that most of the time
2017-12-13 18:24:54	_alex_w__	it can be more expensive with machine tools because the tooling usually runs at least as much as the machine, and some might not carry over into the upgrade

2017-12-13 18:30:19	@Bill-Rangatira	good morning
2017-12-13 18:31:15	@Bill-Rangatira	removed a bunch of friction out of the outhaul on the boat I'm racing on
2017-12-13 18:31:45	@Bill-Rangatira	the outhaul was crossing over itself twice
2017-12-13 18:32:25	@Bill-Rangatira	re reeved the lines and added a hitching loop to get better purchase
2017-12-13 18:32:55	@Bill-Rangatira	will try to put a low friction ring in the hitching loop
2017-12-13 18:33:41	_alex_w__	you didn't quit them?
2017-12-13 18:33:41		[18:33]
2017-12-13 18:34:03	@Bill-Rangatira	no almost but not quite
2017-12-13 18:34:05	Marcus_Offsite	I've had to do that with every boat I've ever bought, take the boom into the kitchen and re-run all the internal lines
2017-12-13 18:34:10	Marcus_Offsite	I have no idea how people get them so messed up
2017-12-13 18:34:15	@Bill-Rangatira	the skipper is willing to listen to ideas
2017-12-13 18:34:38	@Bill-Rangatira	this boom has nothing internal
2017-12-13 18:34:49	Marcus_Offsite	that's even worse
2017-12-13 18:35:52	@Bill-Rangatira	i would like to have the outhaul and vang where i can reach them from my station but oh well
2017-12-13 18:37:05	@Bill-Rangatira	maybe the next upgrade that will happen
2017-12-13 18:37:13	_alex_w__	i think both are fine to have someone on the rail take care of
2017-12-13 18:37:20	@Bill-Rangatira	also cleaned and greased one of the winches
2017-12-13 18:37:36	_alex_w__	and if you are flying the kite too hot in a lot of wind it is actually helpful if someone on the rail can have the duty of dumping the vang when you wipe out
2017-12-13 18:37:53	_alex_w__	instead of having you have to change from dealing with the mainsheet
2017-12-13 18:38:39	@Bill-Rangatira	ok i just need to teach our rail the timing of the outhaul and how much for the wind and point of sail

2017-12-13 18:40:19	@Bill-Rangatira	our crew is set up with 2 genoa trimmers a main trimmer a foredeck and helm doing the backstay
2017-12-13 18:40:21	_alex_w__	well, you can initially just ask them "ease vang" or "trim vang"
2017-12-13 18:40:45	_alex_w__	having the outhaul under the front of the boom makes it accessible on any point of sail, and is simpler than running it along the deck
2017-12-13 18:41:11	_alex_w__	in most conditions at least one of your genoa trimmers and the foredeck will be sitting on the rail
2017-12-13 18:41:17	@Bill-Rangatira	yes i can but ease has to be the right amount not dump the whole thing and harden to bend the boom
2017-12-13 18:41:43	_alex_w__	anyone who's been racing should learn that ease means easea  little bit and then ask the person who asked for the ease if that was the right amount
2017-12-13 18:41:52	_alex_w__	i'll also guess and say "ease outhaul 3 inches"
2017-12-13 18:41:59	@Bill-Rangatira	yep
2017-12-13 18:42:00	_alex_w__	or "ease 6 inches"
2017-12-13 18:42:37	_alex_w__	a newport 28 won't wipe out easily, but if you are pushing it i just always ask someone who is idle to hang onto the vang and just to dump it if we start to broach
2017-12-13 18:42:47	@Bill-Rangatira	i think i should put a bit of whipping on the outhaul for min and max
2017-12-13 18:43:18	@Bill-Rangatira	the vang is not too bad
2017-12-13 18:43:44	_alex_w__	this isn't a good or bad thing, it's just that dumping the vang is usuaully necessary to depower the main and get the boat back upright
2017-12-13 18:44:14	@Bill-Rangatira	also need to adjust the cam angle on the cleats
2017-12-13 18:44:25	@Bill-Rangatira	the main is too low as is the vang
2017-12-13 18:45:21	@Bill-Rangatira	the vang is way low and you need to push it forward to release
2017-12-13 18:45:29	_alex_w__	we experimented with vang cleat high (by the boom) and low
2017-12-13 18:46:06	@Bill-Rangatira	i like the vang cam at the top but it is a bit more tangle prone
2017-12-13 18:46:50	_alex_w__	yeah, we liked top better and made it so that a yank down dumps it

2017-12-13 18:47:05	@Bill-Rangatira	but if it is not me doing the adjustment then the issue is not so bad
2017-12-13 18:47:51	_alex_w__	we don't actually adjust the vang that often
2017-12-13 18:48:17	@Bill-Rangatira	the cam is opposite to what we have and i'm not sure if we can flip it over
2017-12-13 18:48:36	_alex_w__	oh, i'm wrong, it is pull up to release
2017-12-13 18:48:38	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/RejQuest-Express-37/i-d5DjXMD/A
2017-12-13 18:48:45	_alex_w__	i think we've talked about flipping it
2017-12-13 18:48:45		[18:48]
2017-12-13 18:48:56	_alex_w__	harken ones are easy to flip.  that is an old photo, maybe we did
2017-12-13 18:48:56	@Bill-Rangatira	we only use the vang when reaching and a bit for downwind
2017-12-13 18:49:31	_alex_w__	us too, but we rarely have to trim it in those conditions
2017-12-13 18:49:43	_alex_w__	i can't think of the lst time we intentionally had a lot of twist going downwind
2017-12-13 18:51:56	@Bill-Rangatira	our regular series are all WL but the long distance are usually once a month and have a reach leg
2017-12-13 18:52:50	@Bill-Rangatira	reaching is the only time the vang is really active
2017-12-13 18:53:08	Marcus_Offsite	is it different in keelboats?  I use the vang downwind a lot
2017-12-13 18:53:20	_alex_w__	Marcus_Offsite: yes, because on dinghies you vang sheet
2017-12-13 18:53:31	Marcus_Offsite	ahh hmmm
2017-12-13 18:53:37	_alex_w__	on keelboats that leads to bending booms
2017-12-13 18:53:38	@Bill-Rangatira	downwind it is usually on vang
2017-12-13 18:53:54	_alex_w__	we have vang on downwind to avoid twist, but i don't adjust it a ton
2017-12-13 18:54:01	Marcus_Offsite	ah okay
2017-12-13 18:54:06	@Bill-Rangatira	yes same here
2017-12-13 18:54:11	_alex_w__	my main is also about 25% of the sail area downwind, we're paying more attention to the kite
2017-12-13 18:54:15	_alex_w__	or reaching
2017-12-13 18:54:25	@Bill-Rangatira	unless we start to submarine
2017-12-13 18:54:51	_alex_w__	it should be very hard to submarine a newport 28.  lots of freeboard, not a powered up boat
2017-12-13 18:55:02	@Bill-Rangatira	yes
2017-12-13 18:55:09	_alex_w__	and a mostly light air region
2017-12-13 18:56:38	@Bill-Rangatira	.. you can ask chip what happens when you have too much vang and not enough sheet
2017-12-13 18:57:32	@Bill-Rangatira	the ranger 33 in our fleet blew his boom
2017-12-13 18:57:44	_alex_w__	on a bad jibe?
2017-12-13 18:58:05	@Bill-Rangatira	broke at the vang in strong air
2017-12-13 18:58:13	_alex_w__	it seems like vangs should probably have a fuse of sorts in them that blows before the boom does
2017-12-13 18:58:21	_alex_w__	like a weak clevis pin securing it to the boom
2017-12-13 18:58:38	@Bill-Rangatira	wooden dowels for shackle pins do just that
2017-12-13 18:58:56	_alex_w__	yeah, but it needs to be properly tuned
2017-12-13 18:59:10	@Bill-Rangatira	and replaced
2017-12-13 18:59:10	Marcus_Offsite	a wooden pin>
2017-12-13 18:59:11	Marcus_Offsite	?
2017-12-13 18:59:58	@Bill-Rangatira	i saw one with a lashing instead of shackle which is also a good thing
2017-12-13 19:00:43	_alex_w__	Marcus_Offsite: i think bill means using a wooden dowel instead of a steel clevis pin to attach the vang to the boom
2017-12-13 19:00:53	_alex_w__	it might fail before the boom does, but you don't really know
2017-12-13 19:01:00	Marcus_Offsite	yeah I just can't see that being durable enough, but ...
2017-12-13 19:01:02	_alex_w__	and it could fail way too early, which is also bad
2017-12-13 19:01:59	@Bill-Rangatira	it would fail from wear
2017-12-13 19:02:01	_alex_w__	this is probably more of a concern on boats that have the vang lead to a winch
2017-12-13 19:08:00		[19:02]

2017-12-13 20:33:24	CalebD_	Did you have to wear something like that Dan ?
2017-12-13 20:34:10	@Dan-NS27	No, but I got issued one. Still in plastic, that I get to turn in.
2017-12-13 20:35:13	@Dan-NS27	Had to look up the part number to confirm what it was in my check list
2017-12-13 20:36:17	CalebD_	PUG
2017-12-13 20:39:42	@Dan-NS27	I went through my checklist again today and have pretty much everything packed for turn in. Hopefully they don't hit me too hard for not having a couple things.

2017-12-13 20:43:38	_alex_w__	they are cheap because they aren't that great
2017-12-13 20:43:52	_alex_w__	if you go folding you want a gear folder, like flex-o-fold or gori
2017-12-13 20:43:52	CalebD_	$150 is pretty reasonable
2017-12-13 20:44:34	@Bill-Rangatira	yes but the gear folders are way out of my budget for now
2017-12-13 20:44:49	@Bill-Rangatira	i guess i should just get a re pitch
2017-12-13 20:45:03	CalebD_	I would stick with fixed blade then
2017-12-13 20:45:18	CalebD_	fixed blades can be re-pitched

2017-12-13 20:46:56	_alex_w__	probably out of your price range, but pretty reasonable
2017-12-13 20:48:37	CalebD_	that is also a pretty good deal
2017-12-13 20:48:43	C3D2	Why is bronze so popular?
2017-12-13 20:49:03	C3D2	Not taking the mickey here, genuine question
2017-12-13 20:49:10	@Bill-Rangatira	not too bad almost cheaper then a re pitch
2017-12-13 20:49:12	CalebD_	anything else rusts, oxidizes or just is inappropriate
2017-12-13 20:49:31	CalebD_	bronze is particularly inert in salt water
2017-12-13 20:49:39	_alex_w__	easy to machine, easy to modify/adjust, does well in salt water, reasonably priced
2017-12-13 20:49:46	@Bill-Rangatira	bronze will also turn pink if not protected with zincs
2017-12-13 20:50:17	@Bill-Rangatira	usually due to stainles shafts
2017-12-13 20:50:28	CalebD_	bronze is also a popular material for making boat through hull fixtures and stuffing boxes
2017-12-13 20:50:41	_alex_w__	featherstream props use stainless blades, but bronze for the mechanism
2017-12-13 20:50:41	C3D2	For the same reasons, I presume?

2017-12-13 20:55:58	@Bill-Rangatira	that prop is too much for my engine i think

2017-12-13 20:56:31	@Bill-Rangatira	a 16 1/2 x 11

2017-12-13 20:57:06	_alex_w__	ah.  what is your final gear ratio?
2017-12-13 20:57:13	@Bill-Rangatira	2.14

2017-12-13 20:57:57	_alex_w__	reverse doesn't matter almost
2017-12-13 20:58:34	@Bill-Rangatira	i could cut a 16 down to work but the pitch should be closer to what i want
2017-12-13 20:59:22	_alex_w__	yeah.  i had a 2.62:1 on both of my boats, so 16x10 works great
2017-12-13 21:00:40	@Bill-Rangatira	i i cut the diam to 13 11 would be close
2017-12-13 21:01:00	@Bill-Rangatira	but that is a major work
2017-12-13 21:01:37	@Bill-Rangatira	3 1/2 is alot to remove ... 1.75 off each blade
2017-12-13 21:04:42	_alex_w__	yeah, and you will probably change the pitch too since the blade is twisted
2017-12-13 21:05:33	@Bill-Rangatira	the other option is to see if there are other blades for that model gori

2017-12-13 22:04:44	Kjango	Never seen anywhere with a death rate like that.
2017-12-13 22:05:44	Kjango	Beef Wellington tonight for dinner......how lucky am I.
2017-12-13 22:05:54	CalebD_	mmm
2017-12-13 22:06:00	CalebD_	who made it ?
2017-12-13 22:06:12	Kjango	A departure from living on potted meat on the boat.......lol
2017-12-13 22:06:26	Kjango	Miss Becky is making it now.
2017-12-13 22:06:43	@Dan-NS27	nice KJ. That's one thing I've been interested in trying out some time.
2017-12-13 22:07:06	CalebD_	I made Beef Carbonade a few days ago, like a Belgian beef stew
2017-12-13 22:07:14	Kjango	This will be only the second time I've ever had it.
2017-12-13 22:07:48	Kjango	That sounds good too Caleb
2017-12-13 22:08:35	Kjango	I usually don't eat much beef......it's hard for me to work past the notion that it comes from cows.
2017-12-13 22:08:35		[22:08]
2017-12-13 22:09:51	CalebD_	You prefer goat or sheep maybe ?
2017-12-13 22:10:56	Kjango	Spend a season nursemaiding a herd of cattle through a Montana winter & when you hear beef all you can think of is all those dripping green assholes.
2017-12-13 22:11:19	CalebD_	nice
2017-12-13 22:11:45	CalebD_	a very appetizing image
2017-12-13 22:12:02	Kjango	That's the point Caleb......lol
2017-12-13 22:12:28	C3D2	Speaking /away zzz

2017-12-13 22:13:04		[C3D2 away: zzz]
2017-12-13 22:13:04	Kjango	I chose up there to live on venison & elk & grouse & trout & leave beef for others.
2017-12-13 22:14:05	Kjango	I do still like cheese burgers though
2017-12-13 22:14:46	Kjango	ok....there's my dinner call......night all
2017-12-13 22:17:09	CalebD_	nite C3D2

2017-12-14 07:20:14	PaulinS	yeah, the older one fell asleep on the way home and has been down for about that long, although I had to try and get him out of his clothes and into PJs
2017-12-14 07:20:32	PaulinS	the little-un, well she's only 12 days old so she's up at odd hours
2017-12-14 07:23:14	Essingto_	ugh ... hopefully she'll be sleeping through the night before long.

2017-12-14 07:28:09	PaulinS	saw that earlier, looks neat, does it come off for cleaning?
2017-12-14 07:28:23	Essingto_	not likely
2017-12-14 07:28:33	Essingto_	it'd take a knife I'll bet
2017-12-14 07:29:26	Essingto_	but it is a water bottle, so the outside shouldn't need much cleaning

2017-12-14 07:33:02	Essingto_	I see what you mean
2017-12-14 07:34:06	PaulinS	lol, an example of how to make a Dodge worse, if such a thing was possible
2017-12-14 07:34:23	Essingto_	But that license plate number is "SAIL"
2017-12-14 07:34:32	Essingto_	so it is fine :-)
2017-12-14 07:35:15	PaulinS	they should have replaced it with a nice destroyer stainless wheel
2017-12-14 07:35:22	Essingto_	dunno, dodge with 200,000 miles on it and still running just fine ... if that's bad, I'm o.k. with it
2017-12-14 07:36:26	PaulinS	cant argue with that, assuming it hasnt had 2 new engines, 3 transmissions....
2017-12-14 07:36:51	Essingto_	nope
2017-12-14 07:37:16	Essingto_	ram 2500 with a cummins 5.9 ... it is just getting broke in ...
2017-12-14 07:37:46	PaulinS	ah right, yeah, not a dodge engine
2017-12-14 07:40:48	Essingto_	yeah ... don't think it matters ... as long as you don't drive like a teenager ...
2017-12-14 07:41:45	Essingto_	As far as trucks go, I've owned ford, chevy, Nissan, Mazda, and now the Dodge.
2017-12-14 07:43:00	PaulinS	i have a honda
2017-12-14 07:43:10	Essingto_	I like the dodge the best so far ... but that may just be due to it being the nicest vehicle I've ever owned ...
2017-12-14 07:43:31	Essingto_	PaulinS : honda truck?
2017-12-14 07:43:39	Essingto_	ridgeline?
2017-12-14 07:43:42	PaulinS	yeah
2017-12-14 07:43:55	Essingto_	how do you like it?
2017-12-14 07:44:06	PaulinS	perfect for my needs, it is fantastic
2017-12-14 07:44:44	PaulinS	i dont need to tow 10000lbs or haul 1000lbs in the bed
2017-12-14 07:45:06	Essingto_	I've seen a few of them ... they look a bit small for the shit I drag around though
2017-12-14 07:45:26	PaulinS	but i do need quiet, comfortable, good handling, economy, and just tons of storage
2017-12-14 07:46:42	PaulinS	took the family camping for a long weekend, got all the gear in, plus the people and still left the whole bed free for the dogs
2017-12-14 07:47:09	PaulinS	nothing on the market that matches it

2017-12-14 07:49:16	PaulinS	lol, our was real camping
2017-12-14 07:50:24	PaulinS	https://photos.app.goo.gl/fHceHFgyQDIvNlnm1
2017-12-14 07:50:27	Essingto_	If I want my wife to come camping, the "tent" must include a flush toilet and a furnace
2017-12-14 07:50:58	PaulinS	fair enough, the honda will still tow 5000lbs though, so not exactly useless
2017-12-14 07:51:13	Essingto_	when I go camping, all my shit fits on the motorcycle ... or on my back
2017-12-14 07:54:09	PaulinS	i prefer minimal stuff, but wife/sprog requires more
2017-12-14 07:54:42	Essingto_	yeah, when we had the kids, the wife required "controllable environment"
2017-12-14 07:56:02	Essingto_	this was my setup for my last camping trip this fall: https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4555/39045713851_72a8006101_b.jpg
2017-12-14 07:56:50	Essingto_	turns out, hammock camping in the snow isn't all that bad
2017-12-14 08:02:00		[07:56]
2017-12-14 08:03:25	Essingto_	how do the non-level bed rails effect things like covering or tying down a load in that truck?
2017-12-14 08:06:58	PaulinS	plenty of tiedown points inside
2017-12-14 08:07:22	PaulinS	plus you can get tonneau etc
2017-12-14 08:07:33	Essingto_	how does that work?
2017-12-14 08:07:42	Essingto_	must not sit on the bed rails?
2017-12-14 08:07:57	Essingto_	or just does't ride flat?
2017-12-14 08:09:16	PaulinS	i think the tonneau cover has a rail inside
2017-12-14 08:09:38	PaulinS	mine doesnt have that cover so dont know for sure
2017-12-14 08:10:04	PaulinS	but its not designed as a "work" truck really
2017-12-14 08:10:36	Essingto_	yeah
2017-12-14 08:11:56	Essingto_	judging by what I've seen with my truck, even the 1500 (1/2 ton) versions aren't built to take much (ab) use.
2017-12-14 08:13:39	Essingto_	is the ridgeline considered a "full size" truck?
2017-12-14 08:14:03	Essingto_	or is it like the chevy colorado ...
2017-12-14 08:14:10	PaulinS	mid size
2017-12-14 08:14:18	Essingto_	o.k.
2017-12-14 08:14:30	PaulinS	more tacoma sized
2017-12-14 08:14:55	Essingto_	gotcha
2017-12-14 08:15:46	PaulinS	a truck for people that dont need a "Truck", but need truckish capabilities
2017-12-14 08:15:52		[C3D2 back: gone 10:02:48]
2017-12-14 08:16:07	PaulinS	which is most ppl really, aside from contractors
2017-12-14 08:16:30	Essingto_	or people dragging heavy shit
2017-12-14 08:17:09	Essingto_	around here 2500 and 3500 diesels seem to be the norm
2017-12-14 08:17:09		[08:17]
2017-12-14 08:17:32	Essingto_	mostly ranch trucks
2017-12-14 08:19:16	C3D2	Essingto_: Nice to see a fellow hammock camper
2017-12-14 08:20:13	Essingto_	C3D2: I'm and old man ... can't bring myself to lie on the ground ...
2017-12-14 08:20:25	Essingto_	that and I have a hard time getting back up :-)
2017-12-14 08:21:05	Essingto_	hammock is easier ... just roll out, kinda like bed at home
2017-12-14 08:21:58	PaulinS	most trucks round here spend all their time with an empty bed
2017-12-14 08:22:16	PaulinS	seems little point having all the compromises a truck has if you arent going to be trucky
2017-12-14 08:23:18	Essingto_	yeah
2017-12-14 08:24:11	PaulinS	the ridgeline is more like an SUV with a truck back
2017-12-14 08:24:28	PaulinS	best thing is a huge under-bed trunk
2017-12-14 08:24:56	Essingto_	oh?
2017-12-14 08:25:20	Essingto_	like a drawer or something?

2017-12-14 08:25:36	Essingto_	how do you get into it if you've got shit in the bed?
2017-12-14 08:25:47	PaulinS	you don't. but that's not really the point of it
2017-12-14 08:25:48	PaulinS	http://image.motortrend.com/f/wot/top-10-vehicles-for-labor-day-tailgating-255185/55275722/2012-honda-ridgeline-bed-storage.jpg
2017-12-14 08:26:34	Essingto_	well shit ... that is just like a SUV...
2017-12-14 08:26:45	PaulinS	so we filled that with camping gear, and the dogs still had the whole back to themselves, and we didn't have to smell them
2017-12-14 08:27:00	Essingto_	nice
2017-12-14 08:27:11	C3D2	o/ ingmar_
2017-12-14 08:27:41	PaulinS	yep, for us it's the perfect vehicle, there was literally nothing else for sale that did what it did
2017-12-14 08:27:59	PaulinS	and it drives like a nice SUV not a truck, which is great
2017-12-14 08:28:09	Essingto_	huh, so the box isn't separate from the body ... it is a convertable (converted) SUV without a 3rd row seat
2017-12-14 08:28:28	PaulinS	no, it's not quite a ladder, and not quite a unibody
2017-12-14 08:28:34	PaulinS	sort of a hybrid
2017-12-14 08:29:23	Essingto_	still a pretty good looking truck
2017-12-14 08:29:35	Essingto_	how long have you had it?
2017-12-14 08:30:49	PaulinS	picked it up in June
2017-12-14 08:30:59	Essingto_	honda has a pretty good reputation for reliability ... I wonder how the ridgeline is going to compare?
2017-12-14 08:31:16	PaulinS	plenty of the earlier ones are well past 200,000 miles
2017-12-14 08:31:42	PaulinS	mine's done 140k kms, which is what, 90k miles, and it drives like new
2017-12-14 08:31:48	Essingto_	do they put a 6cyl engine in that?
2017-12-14 08:31:57	PaulinS	yeah, 3.5l V6 gas engine in mine
2017-12-14 08:32:16	Essingto_	huh
2017-12-14 08:32:16		[08:32]
2017-12-14 08:32:19	Essingto_	damn
2017-12-14 08:32:31	Essingto_	my jeep had a 4l 6 ...
2017-12-14 08:33:10	Essingto_	and that engine could barely push the thing to highway speeds
2017-12-14 08:33:27	PaulinS	this is 250hp, and about the same torque
2017-12-14 08:33:33	Essingto_	Honda must be pushing more HP ...
2017-12-14 08:33:37	Essingto_	heah, that
2017-12-14 08:35:06	PaulinS	24v VTEC engine, it's pretty nice
2017-12-14 08:35:25	PaulinS	variable torque 4wd etc
2017-12-14 08:35:30	Essingto_	you'd think that they could push more HP out of 3l ...
2017-12-14 08:35:57	PaulinS	problem is that also pushes the torque higher up the rev range
2017-12-14 08:36:07	PaulinS	which isnt ideal for a truck
2017-12-14 08:36:09	Essingto_	my motorcycle is just below 1L and it pushes over 100hp
2017-12-14 08:36:33	PaulinS	probably makes that at 12k RPM though
2017-12-14 08:36:34	Essingto_	and it isn't anything fancy
2017-12-14 08:37:06	Essingto_	I think the max HP is down around 9k
2017-12-14 08:37:20	Essingto_	redline is 10.5k If I remember
2017-12-14 08:37:53	Essingto_	My cummins is a different beast though ...
2017-12-14 08:37:58	Essingto_	my first diesel
2017-12-14 08:38:10	Essingto_	that thing is stupid!
2017-12-14 08:38:28	PaulinS	yup
2017-12-14 08:38:38	Essingto_	6 coffee can sized pistons that can move mountains
2017-12-14 08:38:47	PaulinS	also, your bike probably only makes 50ftlb of torque
2017-12-14 08:38:52	Essingto_	and the thing redlines at 3k
2017-12-14 08:39:03	PaulinS	cant beat a big TD for torque
2017-12-14 08:39:16	Essingto_	yeah, don't remember the torque rating on the bike
2017-12-14 08:39:33	Essingto_	whatever it is, it is WAY more than I need
2017-12-14 08:40:18	PaulinS	my little old FIAT made nice numbers, 2l engine 240bhp, 220lb peak torque, and 200+ ft lb of torque from 1400rpm through to the redline
2017-12-14 08:40:23	PaulinS	made for a fun drive
2017-12-14 08:40:37	Essingto_	that's more like it
2017-12-14 08:41:39	PaulinS	that was a 5 cylinder, 20v, turbocharged, intercooled, variable valve timing
2017-12-14 08:42:21	PaulinS	3rd gear was a monster, would take you from 30mph to 100mph in the same time as a non-turbo 911
2017-12-14 08:42:28	PaulinS	actually a whisker quicker
2017-12-14 08:42:43	Essingto_	heh
2017-12-14 08:42:52	PaulinS	I miss that car so much
2017-12-14 08:43:59	Essingto_	before I re-geared my bike, by the time you kicked it into 2nd (on a quick launch) you were already doing 60
2017-12-14 08:44:35	PaulinS	well yeah, bikes are a different performance altogether
2017-12-14 08:44:46	PaulinS	unless it's wet, or you want to carry 4 people and their bags ;)
2017-12-14 08:45:07	Essingto_	I wanted to be able to go slower off road, so I dropped the front sprocket 2 teeth
2017-12-14 08:45:36	Essingto_	yup
2017-12-14 08:45:43	PaulinS	the engine bay was a little cramped, a bitch to work on, https://photos.app.goo.gl/bq2E8A9UlWd7nes43
2017-12-14 08:46:13	Essingto_	hey, that looks like the engine compartment of my old Saab ...
2017-12-14 08:47:07	Essingto_	if you want to change the alternator (or starter, or even the oil) better plan for it to take all weekend.
2017-12-14 08:48:01	PaulinS	outside was quite nice mind, https://photos.app.goo.gl/jAix2UtE0ErVCBkL2
2017-12-14 08:48:01		[08:48]
2017-12-14 08:48:37	Essingto_	not so much the family car?
2017-12-14 08:48:54	PaulinS	no, although it did seat 4 quite comfortably and had a decent trunk
2017-12-14 08:50:23	Essingto_	cool
2017-12-14 08:51:07	Essingto_	it has been about 10 years since I've even looked at anything smaller than a large SUV
2017-12-14 08:51:23	Essingto_	... or motorcycle (I have to escape sometimes)
2017-12-14 08:51:30	PaulinS	I'd love to import one
2017-12-14 08:51:38	PaulinS	have that as my other toy, wife can use the honda
2017-12-14 08:52:03	Essingto_	hehe
2017-12-14 08:52:36	Essingto_	I just saw some reviews of the Jeep Grand Cherokee "track hawk"
2017-12-14 08:52:39	C3D2	Man, I wish I could afford to drive
2017-12-14 08:52:51	C3D2	I enjoy it but I'm getting hung out to dry by insurance companie
2017-12-14 08:52:55	PaulinS	I hear you C3
2017-12-14 08:53:00	Essingto_	figured I could replace the wife's durango with that ...
2017-12-14 08:53:05	PaulinS	although insurance isnt the issue for me
2017-12-14 08:53:05	C3D2	s/companie/companies
2017-12-14 08:53:16	Essingto_	nothing like a SUV with a 750hp engine :-)
2017-12-14 08:53:21	C3D2	Go on, PaulinS
2017-12-14 08:54:19	PaulinS	oh, I got laid off last week
2017-12-14 08:54:31	PaulinS	the grand cherokee is OK
2017-12-14 08:54:33	Essingto_	what you drive has a big impact on your insurance bill
2017-12-14 08:54:57	PaulinS	the smaller one though, yeah, I saw the front end of them described as Clint Eastwood taking a shit
2017-12-14 08:55:08	C3D2	Pretty good excuse as far as they go - got something else lined up?
2017-12-14 08:55:10	Essingto_	PaulinS: Track Hawk ... beyond that, I'd not be interested in the cherokee
2017-12-14 08:55:21	PaulinS	not so far
2017-12-14 08:55:31	PaulinS	and this close to christmas, unlikely to find anything either
2017-12-14 08:55:51	C3D2	Essingto_: I know, but a 10-y/o Ford Fiesta 1.1 shouldn't be almost £2200 pa
2017-12-14 08:56:09	PaulinS	must be a youngster then?
2017-12-14 08:56:19	C3D2	mhm
2017-12-14 08:56:27	C3D2	Can't even drink over in the states
2017-12-14 08:56:45	PaulinS	right, yeah, insurance is crazy for you then, but mostly because you are most likely to crash lol
2017-12-14 08:57:29	PaulinS	I dont remember what I used to pay for my first car back in the UK, it was a FIAT Uno 1.1, would have been probably a grand even back in those days (mid 90s)
2017-12-14 08:57:29	C3D2	I wouldn't mind so much but £2200 is black-boxed, with the car doing less than 6k a year
2017-12-14 08:57:45	C3D2	Most of which wouldn't be driven by me, what with it being not my car
2017-12-14 08:57:45	Essingto_	hah!
2017-12-14 08:58:05	Essingto_	I pay something like $500/yr
2017-12-14 08:58:10	PaulinS	early 90s I guess, sheet I am old lol
2017-12-14 08:58:17	C3D2	Ah well, now I get to piss off everyone on my bike
2017-12-14 08:58:28	PaulinS	I used to pay 250 quid for my Coupe, which was a group 20
2017-12-14 08:58:40	C3D2	Who'd've thought that actually following the law would be so annoying
2017-12-14 08:58:44	PaulinS	that's what 12 years no claims and lots of driving experience gets you
2017-12-14 08:59:22	PaulinS	insurance here is pretty expensive because there's no competition, you have to get it from the Provincial insurer
2017-12-14 08:59:26	PaulinS	so they fuck you over
2017-12-14 08:59:42	PaulinS	I think the ridgeline is about$1500 a year even with 10 years claim free discount
2017-12-14 09:01:02	Essingto_	damn
2017-12-14 09:07:00		[09:01]
2017-12-14 09:08:05	PaulinS	indeed
2017-12-14 09:10:53	PaulinS	still, my boat insurance is ok
2017-12-14 09:11:04	PaulinS	$200 a year
2017-12-14 09:12:02	PaulinS	hull, equipment and $3mill liability

2017-12-14 17:22:19	@Dan-NS27	Not too bad, just getting things signed off to leave the army.
2017-12-14 17:28:00		[17:22]
2017-12-14 17:29:03	@Bill-Rangatira	congrats on joining civvy life dan
2017-12-14 17:30:47	Marcus_Offsite	congratulations on lasting 20 and getting that sweet retirement package
2017-12-14 17:30:58	CalebD_	it is a process, I gather
2017-12-14 17:31:29	@Dan-NS27	Getting there. :)
2017-12-14 17:31:46	@Dan-NS27	Caleb, yes, it's a process and not always pleasant.
2017-12-14 17:34:53	CalebD_	well, they have invested in you.  I guess they don't want to give up on their "investent" so easily.
2017-12-14 17:35:37	CalebD_	which explains why some folks choose the military as a career
2017-12-14 17:37:33	@Bill-Rangatira	it is one of the few carrers left you can stay with until retirement

2017-12-14 17:40:50	CalebD_	probably not for the better

2017-12-14 17:52:48	@Dan-NS27	Thought the motor on the Tarheel was jammed but I plugged the power cable from the motor controller to a different plug and it's working again.

2017-12-15 03:18:10	CalebD_	I guess you have your Marieholm tarped up nicely
2017-12-15 03:18:15	MarcusHome	new initiative, but we are to do it 5x a year, and plan the next 10 weeks of work

2017-12-15 03:20:42	MarcusHome	hi paul
2017-12-15 03:21:18	PaulinS	how goes it?
2017-12-15 03:22:12	MarcusHome	pretty good
2017-12-15 03:22:27	MarcusHome	washed the boat on tues, all the hardware I rebedded is not leaking, so I got that going for me
2017-12-15 03:22:34	CalebD_	No complaints here.  Also no MiL ... ;-)
2017-12-15 03:24:42	PaulinS	lucky you
2017-12-15 03:26:18	CalebD_	my MiL would not condone my liberal amounts of libations

2017-12-15 03:27:56	CalebD_	fortunately she is not here to cluck about it
2017-12-15 03:32:13	PaulinS	I sadly have few drinking opportunities
2017-12-15 03:32:45	CalebD_	I take it you are not a "wine person" ?
2017-12-15 03:34:56	PaulinS	i like wine
2017-12-15 03:35:38	CalebD_	cuz 1 bottle a night with a meal can be an excuse to get in a little alcohol while enjoying a meal
2017-12-15 03:36:20	CalebD_	with the pretense of being cultured or gourmet
2017-12-15 03:36:43	PaulinS	hard to do when it comes out a box lol
2017-12-15 03:37:01	CalebD_	ok, so 1 box a night then
2017-12-15 03:37:13	CalebD_	the more the better - the worse the hangover
2017-12-15 03:37:33	MarcusHome	I'm a pretty big cork dork
2017-12-15 03:38:34	CalebD_	we do some wine.  Recent favorites are Malbecs from Argentina, some Chilean wines and some S. African stuff can be very good
2017-12-15 03:40:46	CalebD_	also recently had some Guwertzentrammer from Germany
2017-12-15 03:41:10	CalebD_	I am an equal opportunity drinker
2017-12-15 03:41:17	CalebD_	in moderation
2017-12-15 03:41:22	PaulinS	not a fan of german wines
2017-12-15 03:41:22		[03:41]
2017-12-15 03:41:51	CalebD_	me either as a rule.  Was nice to try one after not having it in ... forever
2017-12-15 03:42:17	CalebD_	that slightly sweet white wine thing they do over there
2017-12-15 03:42:41	CalebD_	not super sweet like Kosher wines in the US though
2017-12-15 03:42:41	PaulinS	bleurgh
2017-12-15 03:42:53	PaulinS	hate sweet wine
2017-12-15 03:42:55	CalebD_	it was one bottle
2017-12-15 03:43:04	CalebD_	and it was good
2017-12-15 03:43:13	CalebD_	I would not have forced you to drink it Paul
2017-12-15 03:43:20	PaulinS	lol
2017-12-15 03:43:37	CalebD_	I happily helped to finish it
2017-12-15 03:43:57	CalebD_	not finishing a fith bottle of wine is a crime
2017-12-15 03:44:04	CalebD_	fifth
2017-12-15 03:44:12	CalebD_	it just goes bad
2017-12-15 03:44:25	CalebD_	for reds that is
2017-12-15 03:44:37	CalebD_	white wines can be refigerated for a few days
2017-12-15 03:44:48	PaulinS	bottles never go unfinished here
2017-12-15 03:44:50	CalebD_	chlling a good red wine kills it, imho
2017-12-15 03:45:13	CalebD_	glad to hear that no wine was molested at your house
2017-12-15 03:45:34	PaulinS	cellar temp is the coldest they should ever get
2017-12-15 03:45:52	CalebD_	yes
2017-12-15 03:46:39	CalebD_	I recently ordered 3 bottles of wine from an outfit in California, 3 bottles from south AMerica
2017-12-15 03:47:19	CalebD_	I think they haven't shipped them yet because they care about the ambient temperature being as cold as it has been
2017-12-15 03:47:22	CalebD_	0C or <
2017-12-15 03:47:24	PaulinS	wine is so expensive here
2017-12-15 03:47:56	CalebD_	I also just wanted to make sure I could still order wine over the internet and I had used them before
2017-12-15 03:48:25	CalebD_	we try not to spend much more than $10 / bottle here in US
2017-12-15 03:49:01	PaulinS	you couldnt get anything approaching drinkable here for tat
2017-12-15 03:49:41	CalebD_	well we do buy some cheap stuff at like $6 and up
2017-12-15 03:50:02	CalebD_	but it is drinkable, just, but also good for cooking with
2017-12-15 03:50:10	PaulinS	$15 is a start point here
2017-12-15 03:50:34	CalebD_	which I guess translates to about $12 US pesos
2017-12-15 03:50:51	CalebD_	that sounds like a good threshold
2017-12-15 03:50:57	CalebD_	for decent wine
2017-12-15 03:53:54	CalebD_	visiting Argentina really got us hooked on Malbec
2017-12-15 03:54:28	CalebD_	and it was quite cheap because of the exhange rate there/then
2017-12-15 04:00:00		[03:54]
2017-12-15 04:01:03	PaulinS	$15 is something you can drink, 20+ for something decent

2017-12-15 13:53:48	@Sidde	Packet capturing of 10gbit on linux is really heavy on the cpu
2017-12-15 13:54:12	@Sidde	even with accelerated networkcards
2017-12-15 13:54:26	@Sidde	10Gbit on Linux isn't that good acctually

2017-12-15 14:04:45	voryn	sounds like a cool project, I am struggling to get my work to just to cental log storage so we have some middling chance of investigating incidents after the fact let alone anything real time
2017-12-15 14:05:02	voryn	do central*
2017-12-15 14:05:25	@Sidde	i've started working less and less with server stuff with time. But managing datacenters and server managment have been on my table for more or less my entire working life
2017-12-15 14:06:23	@Sidde	voryn: i plan to use my intelligence feeds to both realtime and our log apis

2017-12-15 14:07:18	voryn	my work environment is hostile to opensource, it's pretty embarassing really
2017-12-15 14:07:28	@Sidde	more or less every larger organisation should build log management with opensource products like logstash and graylog
2017-12-15 14:07:52	@Sidde	the cost is only hardware, compared to the very very expensive stuff like Splunk and Arcsight and stuff
2017-12-15 14:08:12	voryn	me and a coworker set up a small poc with ELK and couldn't get even our own manager to look at it

2017-12-15 14:08:52	voryn	but yea, we had time to waste the splunk salesman's time when the project has zero funding...

2017-12-15 14:10:21	voryn	also embarassing
2017-12-15 14:11:20	@Sidde	we're growing a lot now. We'll see how this works in the future. But we have started looking at both Opensource hardware and opensource network hardware

2017-12-15 14:15:56	@Dan-NS27	When I bought my sever, I wanted only to run with Linux. It was built for Windows so Linux didn't work so first but the kernals are far enough now that the server works.

2017-12-15 15:50:13	@Sidde	C3D2: LAPS for local admin accounts on servers yes. Clients shouldn't have a local admin
2017-12-15 15:50:14	_alex_w__	that akzonobel video is pretty crazy.  i'm a little surprised that the sail track came off that easily
2017-12-15 15:50:18	_alex_w__	(i know loads were huge)
2017-12-15 15:51:53	@Sidde	C3D2: and some kind of pam/iam system to give temporary passwords on accounts on server could be a solution where smartcard or hard tokens are'nt used
2017-12-15 15:51:58	@Bill-Rangatira	got all the winches cleaned and re greased /oiled the vang flipped over the outhaul reeved to reduce friction the mainsheet cam angle changed so it will rel;ease if pulled straight back and lifted to lock
2017-12-15 15:52:30	@Marcus	bill I hope they appreciate you, that's a lot of work
2017-12-15 15:53:48	@Bill-Rangatira	i hope to benefit from the work it will make the boat easier to sail

2017-12-15 16:36:47	@Dan-NS27	People I need to see are not around so I'll probably find some lunch then head back to the house.
2017-12-15 16:42:00		[16:36]
2017-12-15 16:45:10	voryn	I feel like I should grease my winches, they don't feel bad to me but I don't have any comparison, I'm afraid to try to open them though as I don't want to end up buying new ones. And it seems mine are old enough that getting parts would be a hassle.
2017-12-15 16:45:47	_alex_w__	cut a hole in a box and put it around them, so that if anything comes off it falls into the box instead of the water
2017-12-15 16:46:01	_alex_w__	winchspares.co.uk has spare parts for almost every lewmar ever made
2017-12-15 16:46:19	_alex_w__	winches should be cleaned and lubed every year if the boat has regular use
2017-12-15 16:46:38	@Dan-NS27	Starting to get frozen rain now. :-\
2017-12-15 16:47:05	@Dan-NS27	Yes, the box is a good idea. Especially being near/on the water.
2017-12-15 16:47:32	_alex_w__	i don't use a box anymore, but i've taken them apart enough that i know when the parts aer going to jump
2017-12-15 16:47:40	_alex_w__	but i did lose a bearing overboard the first time that i took apart a winch
2017-12-15 16:47:48	_alex_w__	thankfully it was a lewmar and parts were available
2017-12-15 16:48:46	voryn	I believe they are maxwell winches
2017-12-15 16:48:56	@Dan-NS27	I haven't lost anything yet. Only worked on the mast winches and one on the boat so far. Need to grease them up. Don't think the PO ever did.
2017-12-15 16:49:11	voryn	I would ideally do it in my driveway so I'd have a decent chance of recovering parts
2017-12-15 16:49:51	voryn	I haven't opened them in the 3 years I have owned the boat and the previous owner seemed like a bigger idiot than me so I'm thinking they haven't been touched for a while
2017-12-15 16:50:39	voryn	also, everything he touched seems to be broken or at least damaged and these seem ok so I feel like he couldn't have worked on them
2017-12-15 16:51:38	voryn	fresh water, stored indoors in winter, so maybe not as bad as it could be
2017-12-15 16:55:54	@Marcus	voryn, remember, previous owner is ALWAYS a moron
2017-12-15 16:57:10	ziper	i use axle grease on fishing reel gears
2017-12-15 16:57:10		[16:57]
2017-12-15 16:57:19	ziper	i'm curious to see how long it does ok
2017-12-15 16:59:18	voryn	Marcus: yep, this guys main issues where never cleaning up any adhesive drips or over applications, and the torque setting on his elbow was always set to "strip"
2017-12-15 17:01:21	_alex_w__	are they the small maxwell winches?
2017-12-15 17:01:39	voryn	The internet is telling me they are maxwell 14
2017-12-15 17:01:59	voryn	boat is a hunter 23 and I have no reason to believe they are not the factory supplied winches
2017-12-15 17:02:17	_alex_w__	i think those are super simple
2017-12-15 17:02:40	_alex_w__	the drum just turns on a plain nylon bearing thati s the hub, there isn't much in them besides some pawls
2017-12-15 17:02:51	_alex_w__	they should still be cleaned to remove any grit and oil the pawls
2017-12-15 17:04:30	voryn	when you open these, is it the sort of procedure where some spring loaded part launches out prior to you being able to see where it was or you can just take your time so you know how it goes back together?
2017-12-15 17:04:51	@Marcus	if they're anything like mine the pawls stay attached
2017-12-15 17:04:55	@Marcus	you just pull the drum up
2017-12-15 17:05:15	_alex_w__	yeah, normally spring pressure will hold the pawls in place
2017-12-15 17:05:29	_alex_w__	but if you use the box you'll contain everything
2017-12-15 17:05:34	voryn	sounds like I'm probably worried about nothing then I guess
2017-12-15 17:06:14	_alex_w__	what happens with lewmar winches is that the roller bearings stay inside the drum and then slide out justa fter you've lifted the drum from the winch base
2017-12-15 17:06:33	_alex_w__	but i don't think the maxwell winches have roller bearings, but you can be careful just in case
2017-12-15 17:07:57	voryn	https://forums.sailboatowners.com/index.php?attachments/maxwell-14-jpg.34067/
2017-12-15 17:08:33	_alex_w__	ah, there is a roller bearing
2017-12-15 17:08:52	_alex_w__	so as you lift the drum just stick your hand under the drum so that the bearing can't fall out
2017-12-15 17:09:26	_alex_w__	also, that style of pawl and spring is more likely to self eject (it still shouldn't, but just keep an eye on it)
2017-12-15 17:09:43	_alex_w__	harken and lewmar winches use a captive spring
2017-12-15 17:10:08	_alex_w__	i thinkyou'll be surprised at how fast/easy iti s
2017-12-15 17:11:23	voryn	so you use grease to pack the bearing and oil on the pawls? or grease the whole thing?
2017-12-15 17:12:19	@Marcus	I've been using Buzzy's Slick Honey on bicycle freewheel pawls, seems to work well.  I've heard not to use grease on the ones in winches (or bicycles) because it can gum them up and cause them to not engage
2017-12-15 17:12:19		[17:12]
2017-12-15 17:12:29	@Marcus	I'm sure there's some special pawl oil for winches
2017-12-15 17:14:31	ziper	10w30
2017-12-15 17:14:55	_alex_w__	grease on the drum bearings, oil on the pawls
2017-12-15 17:15:05	_alex_w__	grease is too sticky for the pawls and they might not retract
2017-12-15 17:15:58	_alex_w__	marcus: i just use phil wood oil, also a bike product
2017-12-15 17:16:06	@Marcus	yeah that would be a good choice too
2017-12-15 17:16:18	_alex_w__	it's a little sticky but slick, which is ideal
2017-12-15 17:16:29	_alex_w__	and i always seem to have it on hand
2017-12-15 17:16:33	@Marcus	the slick honey is like that
2017-12-15 17:16:45	@Marcus	great lubricity but sticks to the item in question really well
2017-12-15 17:16:53	@Marcus	used it a lot in powertap hubs, they seem to dry out faster than other hubs
2017-12-15 17:17:18	_alex_w__	ah, i don't have any experience with those
2017-12-15 17:17:29	_alex_w__	all of my hubs are rohloff or shimaon
2017-12-15 17:17:40	voryn	seems easy enough, thanks for the advice
2017-12-15 17:17:50	_alex_w__	well, except the bike that i've been riding the last two months, which has a 20 year old sachs freehub
2017-12-15 17:18:07	_alex_w__	i have a nice xtr hub to build into a wheel for this bike instead, but never seem to get around to it
2017-12-15 17:18:22	_alex_w__	even though it'll save 200 grams which is nice
2017-12-15 17:20:01	@Marcus	all the mountain bike hubs are kings, my road hubs are some cheap chinese stuff off ebay
2017-12-15 17:20:22	@Marcus	wife has my powertap wheel and the front is built on an ancient history ringle mountain hub
2017-12-15 17:20:34	@Bill-Rangatira	i have a tube of lewmar grease and lewmar oil for my winches
2017-12-15 17:20:58	@Bill-Rangatira	they get done every year or 2
2017-12-15 17:21:22	_alex_w__	chris king hubs are awesome, except for the racket that they make while riding with them
2017-12-15 17:21:38	@Bill-Rangatira	i need to pull the car off my main traveller and replace some balls
2017-12-15 17:21:39	_alex_w__	better on mtbs than the road for that reason
2017-12-15 17:21:45	@Marcus	that racket is good for telling people to gtfo
2017-12-15 17:22:01	@Marcus	:)
2017-12-15 17:22:12	_alex_w__	i think shimano rear hubs are a really elegant design and they are cheap, so they are my defualt
2017-12-15 17:22:22	@Marcus	but for mountain yeah on the road  it might get old.  the newer king hubs are a  lot quieter than the old ones
2017-12-15 17:22:25	_alex_w__	2 bearings vs 4, smaller/lighter axle
2017-12-15 17:22:37	_alex_w__	yeah, i haven't ridden a newer one

2017-12-15 17:23:10	_alex_w__	my travel bike has a hugi (now dt swiss) which also make a racket.  they are kind of similar but not really to the chris king ratchet
2017-12-15 17:23:30	_alex_w__	i use it because they are trivial to disassemble, so i can pull the cassette off and store it in a bag where it doesn't scratch up the bike
2017-12-15 17:23:43	_alex_w__	tool free, it just slides off
2017-12-15 17:24:33	_alex_w__	the silly thing is that it has an aluminum freehub body to save weight, but the design requires 4 bearings instead of 2, so it weighs more than a shimano xt
2017-12-15 17:24:54	@Marcus	hah
2017-12-15 17:25:03	@Marcus	aluminum freehub bodies always get chewed up by the cogs on my bikes
2017-12-15 17:25:19	_alex_w__	that bike has a spidered cassette
2017-12-15 17:25:48	@Marcus	I'd like to switch to 1x11 on my mtb but don't ride it enough to justify that kind of $$$ right now
2017-12-15 17:25:53	_alex_w__	i think all of my derailleured bikes have cassettes with spiders actually
2017-12-15 17:26:16	_alex_w__	my mtb has a rohloff, so it is 1x14
2017-12-15 17:26:29	_alex_w__	so does my touring bike
2017-12-15 17:26:52	@Marcus	I think it's my road bike that isn't spidered
2017-12-15 17:26:52	_alex_w__	the 1x11 stuff is cool, mostly for making it so much easier to build fatbikes
2017-12-15 17:27:11	@Marcus	eliminates that front shifting which is always a pain but you sacrifice top end
2017-12-15 17:27:32	@Marcus	I always liked racing with a 3x9 because I could get it into 40x11 and really hammer on the flats
2017-12-15 17:27:32		[17:27]
2017-12-15 17:27:36	_alex_w__	i don't really care about top end.  on a mtb i'm fine with 20-80" gear range
2017-12-15 17:27:49	_alex_w__	for touring 20-105" or so is fine
2017-12-15 17:28:44	_alex_w__	even my go-fast bike has a 44x11 top gear (700x30 tires) and that's fine.  i don't mind spinning high rpms if i have to sprint, and my normal cadence is around 100-110rpm
2017-12-15 17:29:49	_alex_w__	but i'm also not racing, so there isn't any reason for me to pedal at speeds much over 30mph, if i'm going that fast it's downhill and i'll be faster to get aero
2017-12-15 17:33:20	@Marcus	is it very hilly there?
2017-12-15 17:36:28	_alex_w__	yes
2017-12-15 17:36:36	_alex_w__	riding here is all up and down
2017-12-15 17:36:41	@Dan-NS27	Now getting a light steady frozen rain.
2017-12-15 17:37:11	_alex_w__	so the 20 mile version of my commute is about 2000' of climbing, even though the highest point is maybe 300' above sea level
2017-12-15 17:37:51	_alex_w__	normal touring days are about 6000-10000' of climbing in 50-70 miles

2017-12-15 18:37:07	_alex_w__	i've never encountered someone who thought it was good to do org announcements on a friday afternoon just before most people (including the announcer) leave on a 2 week vacation
2017-12-15 18:38:41	_alex_w__	anyway, i've pretty much always had good managers, so it'll be nice to be there again

2017-12-15 18:45:00	_alex_w__	i've been waiting 20 years for that bike lane to exist
2017-12-15 18:46:46	@Marcus	damn

2017-12-15 19:04:11	Mr_Bubz	why do people store boats, RV's, etc. under trees?
2017-12-15 19:04:15	Mr_Bubz	hey Marcus
2017-12-15 19:04:15	@Dan-NS27	Looking for a different boat?
2017-12-15 19:04:19	Mr_Bubz	no
2017-12-15 19:04:25	@Marcus	matt - lack of a better place?
2017-12-15 19:06:50	Mr_Bubz	I guess.
2017-12-15 19:06:59	Mr_Bubz	they just get tree dander all over them

2017-12-15 19:08:26	Mr_Bubz	that is a com pac 19.  friend has one.  great boat, but tiny
2017-12-15 19:08:41	Mr_Bubz	$1500 is a great price if it just needs cleaned up

2017-12-15 19:12:35	_alex_w__	i got confused by the think line (probably jib halyard) hanging loose by the forestay

2017-12-15 19:25:55	_alex_w__	that class of boat has the most proven top 5 results

2017-12-15 19:39:09	singlerider	elektron: I expect to leave at 6am, which is low tide (not ideal), but it will probably take 6.5 to 7 hours. Let's call it around noon
2017-12-15 19:39:10	+elektron	Depending on timing, I may be able to help you from the dock
2017-12-15 19:39:25	@Marcus	wish I were there, I'd be happy to help
2017-12-15 19:39:26	+elektron	what dock are you heading to?

2017-12-15 19:39:46	+elektron	cool
2017-12-15 19:40:01	singlerider	I'm not a fan of shared slips, though :'(
2017-12-15 19:40:26	singlerider	My big girl weighs 17,500 lbs and doesn't fancy maneuvering at low speeds

2017-12-15 19:44:42	singlerider	I want a Porta Bote
2017-12-15 19:44:42	@Marcus	it's not required, but spending some time sailing small boats will help you handling the big one, I think
2017-12-15 19:44:57	CalebD_	^^^
2017-12-15 19:44:58	Mr_Bubz	"quit playing with your dinghy"

2017-12-15 19:45:02	singlerider	But those weren't my boats :p
2017-12-15 19:45:14	@Marcus	I still think  small boat sailing helps a lot
2017-12-15 19:45:32	@Marcus	it'll make you a better boat handler
2017-12-15 19:46:16	singlerider	when I said "high winds," I meant for December
2017-12-15 19:46:39	singlerider	17 knots is going to be great, even though it's coming from the exact direction I want to go (as usual)
2017-12-15 19:46:59	@Marcus	that's about what we had at finn nationals on the second day, it was fun
2017-12-15 19:47:15	singlerider	Marcus: Don't get my wrong - I'm not afraid to tack
2017-12-15 19:47:15		[19:47]
2017-12-15 19:47:51	@Marcus	you're going to enter your slip under sail, right?
2017-12-15 19:48:07	singlerider	BUT it will make the journey take longer. I'm leaving so early because the marina closes early
2017-12-15 19:48:11	singlerider	nope, motor
2017-12-15 19:49:14	@Marcus	I was kidding
2017-12-15 19:50:24	@Marcus	I suspect it'd be tough to do in that marina, it looks tight

2017-12-15 20:24:02	_alex_w__	good that you had practiced.  i practice for the same reason
2017-12-15 20:24:21	@Marcus	I've only docked a boat under power once
2017-12-15 20:24:32	@Marcus	but only handful of times has t hat been a keelboat
2017-12-15 20:24:37	_alex_w__	our marina breakwater is open at both ends, so you can always sail in downwind
2017-12-15 20:24:58	_alex_w__	then it is beam reach down my fairway, and in winter the final turn is downwind, in summer it is upwind
2017-12-15 20:26:38	Mr_Bubz	good deal
2017-12-15 20:28:15	Mr_Bubz	I don't recall a time when we ever had wind that prevented us from sailing in, other than when there was no wind at all
2017-12-15 20:28:15		[20:28]
2017-12-15 20:29:07	_alex_w__	when i taught sailing on engineless boats the dock that we used was almost always up or down wind
2017-12-15 20:29:37	_alex_w__	the hardest time that i had with teaching people to dock was when we had an easterly, wind blowing right at the dock
2017-12-15 20:29:50	_alex_w__	it's very hard to depower a boat on a beam reach when the boat has swept spreaders
2017-12-15 20:30:14	Mr_Bubz	the Melges 24 next to me sails both out of and into his slip.  it's pretty impressive.
2017-12-15 20:30:26	Mr_Bubz	I have to use the motor when leaving the slip

2017-12-15 20:30:47	_alex_w__	i sail on a friend's yankee 30 that sails in and out of his slip, there is no motor
2017-12-15 20:31:04	Mr_Bubz	cool
2017-12-15 20:31:11	_alex_w__	we just turn the boat in the slip first so that it's pointing the right way
2017-12-15 20:31:21	_alex_w__	if it is a southerly we can just put up the main and go
2017-12-15 20:31:47	_alex_w__	if it is a northerly (that's the direction the bow faces too) we have to get the boat sideways in the fairawy, then power up and go
2017-12-15 20:31:48	gkwhc	hey everyone! im new to sailing and i cant seem to find clear resources about sail controls. like for the main sail, theres the sheet, traveler, and halyard right?
2017-12-15 20:32:07	_alex_w__	how simple or complex do you want?
2017-12-15 20:32:22	_alex_w__	the simplest set of mainsail controls are halyard, outhaul, and sheet
2017-12-15 20:32:24	Mr_Bubz	what boat?
2017-12-15 20:32:58	gkwhc	no boat, just ingeneral
2017-12-15 20:33:11	_alex_w__	a complex set would be: halyard, sheet, traveler, vang, outhaul, cunningham, checkstays, backstay, flattener
2017-12-15 20:33:23	_alex_w__	almost all boats are between those two sets
2017-12-15 20:33:28	gkwhc	oh geeze thats alot haha
2017-12-15 20:33:44	gkwhc	if i understand it correctly, halyard controls the up and down of sails
2017-12-15 20:33:52	gkwhc	what about sheet vs traveler?
2017-12-15 20:33:54	_alex_w__	halyard raises and lowers the sail, and sets luff tension
2017-12-15 20:34:14	gkwhc	ah yes
2017-12-15 20:34:15	_alex_w__	sheet, vang, and traveler all together control leech tension and attack angle
2017-12-15 20:34:37	_alex_w__	when you are upwind sheet controls leech tension, and traveler controls angle of attack
2017-12-15 20:34:46	_alex_w__	when downwind the vang controls leech tension and the sheet controls angle of attack

2017-12-15 20:36:26	Mr_Bubz	here's a simple mainsheet rigging: http://donsnotes.com/sports/sailing/mainsheet.jpg
2017-12-15 20:38:48	gkwhc	_alex_w__: huh so what sheet/traveler controls are flipped if boat is going upwind/downwind
2017-12-15 20:38:58	_alex_w__	gkwhc: the goal is to have one control pull the boom down, and another let it move side to side
2017-12-15 20:39:20	_alex_w__	the traveler works great for moving the boom side to side as long as the end of the boom is inside the boat (on most boats)
2017-12-15 20:39:33	_alex_w__	so then you can use the sheet to pull the boom down, and the traveler to move it side to side
2017-12-15 20:40:02	gkwhc	i see
2017-12-15 20:40:04	_alex_w__	when you are going downwind the vang is used to pull the boom down.  it's pulling the center of the boom and at a bad cosine angle, so it can't pull as hard.  that is okay for downwind sailing
2017-12-15 20:40:20	_alex_w__	this sounds complex, but on the water the transition comes naturally
2017-12-15 20:41:25	gkwhc	_alex_w__: on sailing yachts, are vangs hydraulic then? or are they alsoropes
2017-12-15 20:42:33	_alex_w__	both exist, but hydraulics are only used on huge yachts now
2017-12-15 20:42:45	gkwhc	oh interesting
2017-12-15 20:42:48	_alex_w__	like my boat was made originally with a hydraulic vang, but almost all of the boats swapped to a "rigid vang" instead
2017-12-15 20:42:58	_alex_w__	a rigid vang uses a spring to push the boom up, and has ropes to pull it down
2017-12-15 20:43:18	_alex_w__	on cruising boats the vang is typically just soft (ropes) with a topping lift from the masthead to the back of the boom to lift it

2017-12-15 20:44:15	_alex_w__	you can see the vang there, it is the ram with the red lines underneath

2017-12-15 20:44:42	gkwhc	oooh i see it!
2017-12-15 20:44:54	_alex_w__	you can see the vang on my old boat there, it is the white rope with colored flecks diagonally under the boom
2017-12-15 20:45:26	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/Re-Quest-photos-racing/i-3TqqrXp
2017-12-15 20:45:56	_alex_w__	upwind sailing, so the boom is inside the boat and we're using the traveller (blue and white line in the guys hand wearing the white jacket), and the mainsheet for leech tension
2017-12-15 20:45:57	gkwhc	so for the ram version, it automatically pushes the boom up when you swing the boom for downwind operation?or do you need to supply power to it?
2017-12-15 20:46:05	singlerider	I just ordered a new main halyard
2017-12-15 20:46:19	_alex_w__	when you release the vang control line on a rigid vang the boom will lift
2017-12-15 20:46:36	_alex_w__	on a boat witha  topping lift you'd have to release the vang and trim the topping lift
2017-12-15 20:46:59	_alex_w__	it's pretty rare to want to lift the boom mechanically, it is primarily done in very light air when you want to have good sail shape, and there isn't enough wind to push the sail into that shape
2017-12-15 20:47:01	gkwhc	cool
2017-12-15 20:47:37	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/Re-Quest-photos-racing/i-QFL3z75/A
2017-12-15 20:47:58	gkwhc	_alex_w__: in that sailing picture, where is the mainsheet? is it the guy waving?
2017-12-15 20:48:20	_alex_w__	downwind, so the end of the boom is outside the boat.  the vang is pulling the boom down, and the mainsheet is controlling the boom position.  you can see this especially on bravo zulu because the light is catching their mainsheet
2017-12-15 20:48:29	_alex_w__	it's not vertical, it is at an angle
2017-12-15 20:48:45	_alex_w__	it's harder to see on my boat (with the person in the green jacket)
2017-12-15 20:48:58	_alex_w__	http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/Re-Quest-photos-racing/i-nh35VDj/A
2017-12-15 20:49:19	_alex_w__	that is in really light air, so we're actually moving the boom out by hand (i'm there wearing the bright yellow gloves and doing it)
2017-12-15 20:49:25	gkwhc	ah i was talking about mainsheet in this one http://photos.alexwetmore.org/Sailing/Re-Quest-photos-racing/i-3TqqrXp
2017-12-15 20:49:48	_alex_w__	the mainsheet there is just behind the guy in the yellow jacket
2017-12-15 20:49:57	_alex_w__	with the two sets of nested blocks
2017-12-15 20:50:50	gkwhc	hmm
2017-12-15 20:51:49	gkwhc	is the mainsheet connected to the traveler by a block?

2017-12-15 21:03:47	_alex_w__	which is sort of similar, but sort of different
2017-12-15 21:04:07	_alex_w__	and that one isn't adjustable under load, you can only adjust it when that is the lazy side
2017-12-15 21:04:37	voryn	speaking of travelers, I'm trying to convince myself that it is worth the effort/money to upgrade my traveler. The stock system seems really poor to me using like spring loaded stoppers to manually adjust the car position instead of the block and tackle systems
2017-12-15 21:05:12	_alex_w__	yes, those are pretty awful, the best that you can really do is lock them on centerline and pretend that you don't have one
2017-12-15 21:06:19	tmbg	that's what i did w/ that getaway since it had been too long since i messed w/ a traveler lol
2017-12-15 21:06:29	voryn	yea, half the time I end up doing that, but it feels bad. In any reasonable amount of wind you pretty much have to luff the sail to adjust it
2017-12-15 21:07:22	voryn	It seems I would have to pull the track up to add control blocks to the track

2017-12-15 21:08:13	voryn	looks like you have to slide it on and there is no way to do that without pulling the track
2017-12-15 21:08:32	_alex_w__	you could also sell the boat and have better controls on the next one
2017-12-15 21:08:44	_alex_w__	travelers are expensive.  the ones that adjust under load don't use t-track like that
2017-12-15 21:08:59	voryn	yea, that is ultimately what is in the back of my mind every time I want to upgrade something

2017-12-15 21:18:27	voryn	when I bought this boat I was intending to sail it at a small lake with no travel lift so I specifically was looking for light and shallow draft
2017-12-15 21:19:03	_alex_w__	s2 7.9 would do that, and is a well performing boat.  they are around 26'
2017-12-15 21:19:09	_alex_w__	they have a lifting keel
2017-12-15 21:19:44	voryn	does a lifting keel become a maintenance hassle?

2017-12-15 21:22:09	voryn	the s2 is actually a dagger board
2017-12-15 21:23:50	_alex_w__	yeah, it lifts straight up instead of swinging
2017-12-15 21:23:57	CalebD_	that kind of mechanism would scare me in a hard grounding
2017-12-15 21:24:00	_alex_w__	anyway, those boats have a good reputation and are usually pretty affordable
2017-12-15 21:24:20	_alex_w__	and aren't much bigger than your hunter
2017-12-15 21:24:24	CalebD_	but you west coasters probably never run aground
2017-12-15 21:24:34	_alex_w__	that boat is most popular on the great lakes
2017-12-15 21:24:38	_alex_w__	but there are a few around here
2017-12-15 21:25:35	voryn	CalebD_: my current boat has a transom hung non-folding rudder as the first thing to hit so I'm already pretty scared about that setup
2017-12-15 21:25:35	+elektron	I kayaked out to a guy who was aground out next to the breakwater a week or two ago..
2017-12-15 21:25:59	+elektron	brought some beers and hung out for an hour...
2017-12-15 21:26:14	CalebD_	waiting for the tide ?
2017-12-15 21:26:28	+elektron	gotta keep to the middle at a -1ft low tide
2017-12-15 21:26:36	+elektron	yea..
2017-12-15 21:26:51	_alex_w__	it's hard to run aground here
2017-12-15 21:26:54	+elektron	he was just stuck in mud orsomething..
2017-12-15 21:27:04	CalebD_	We have an 8' tidal range here on the Long Island Sound
2017-12-15 21:27:15	_alex_w__	ours is about 12'
2017-12-15 21:27:33	CalebD_	I was on a wing keeled boat that ran aground (Oday 272) and it stood up on the sand when ALL the water went out around it
2017-12-15 21:27:36	_alex_w__	but it takes a negative tide for me to see anything under 20' deep inside the marina
2017-12-15 21:27:45	+elektron	heh.. this last full supermoon, it was about 6 or 7foot swing
2017-12-15 21:27:50	+elektron	but usually not that high
2017-12-15 21:28:18	CalebD_	we had several hours to wait before that one floated off again.  we were walking around it on the beach a t low tide

2017-12-16 01:50:10	C3D2	Tell me
2017-12-16 01:50:32	C3D2	How bad of an idea would it be to run a full btc node on a Pi I've got lying around here
2017-12-16 01:51:40	singlerider	C3D2: not good
2017-12-16 01:51:58	singlerider	If you intend on mining
2017-12-16 01:53:21	C3D2	Nah, I know that maybe 1Khash/s isn't worth it
2017-12-16 01:54:18	C3D2	But full node as in contributing to network, having full copy of the blockchain (I already have one on my PC) on my Pi
2017-12-16 01:54:26	C3D2	Could be neat, just for s+gs

2017-12-16 02:05:05	ziper	and when it crashes you'll be getting poor off it too

2017-12-16 02:05:19	ziper	do you not wonder why people are investing in a currency
2017-12-16 02:05:51	C3D2	Ziper, there's a differnence between selling everything you own to buy bitcoin and holding onto 1 or 2 you mined a while ago
2017-12-16 02:06:33	C3D2	People getting mortgages to buy btc are somewhat daft, in my opinion, but it's not my money to make a decision with
2017-12-16 02:06:54	ziper	a currency that that has no stable value and requires 200 kilowatt hours per transaction
2017-12-16 02:09:56	C3D2	Got a source on the transaction energy usage?
2017-12-16 02:10:25	ziper	https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/ywbbpm/bitcoin-mining-electricity-consumption-ethereum-energy-climate-change
2017-12-16 02:14:35	C3D2	Interesting

2017-12-18 15:14:55	@Marcus	here's a fun fact
2017-12-18 15:14:59	@Marcus	Gwen Stefani is older than Ted Cruz
2017-12-18 15:15:27	ziper	i dont know enough about gwen stefani for that to bother me
2017-12-18 15:17:42	Mr_Bubs	if this is a "who would you do" I'm definitely picking Gwen Stefani
2017-12-18 15:18:09	Mr_Bubs	I'm not remotely interested in making a sexy time with Ted Cruz
2017-12-18 15:18:20	@Marcus	lol
2017-12-18 15:18:44	@Marcus	ted cruz just seems like such an old fogey, it seems impossible he's younger than gwen
2017-12-18 15:19:02	Mr_Bubs	ted cruz does seem old.
2017-12-18 15:19:16	Mr_Bubs	he's not much older than me, though
2017-12-18 15:23:44	@Marcus	rained on the boat this weekend, no water inside
2017-12-18 15:23:44		[15:23]
2017-12-18 15:23:48	@Marcus	pretty happy about that
2017-12-18 15:24:28	Mr_Bubs	nice
2017-12-18 15:24:45	Mr_Bubs	oh Marcus
2017-12-18 15:24:48	Mr_Bubs	meant to ask you
2017-12-18 15:25:04	Mr_Bubs	how much headroom is in your boat?
2017-12-18 15:25:11	Mr_Bubs	can you stand up OK in there?
2017-12-18 15:25:23	@Marcus	no
2017-12-18 15:25:39	@Marcus	if I take the cover off of the battery compartment in the bilge and stand in there I can st and up
2017-12-18 15:25:51	@Marcus	but on the regular floor I have to tip my  head over onto my shoulder, or hunch
2017-12-18 15:26:03	@Marcus	but I don't plan on holding any ballroom dancing competitions in there so I don't care a bunch
2017-12-18 15:26:10	Mr_Bubs	that's typical for boats that size.  I was just curious
2017-12-18 15:26:38	@Marcus	I think I'd have to go up to a 35' to get standing headroom
2017-12-18 15:26:53	@Marcus	and I can't trailer a boat that big
2017-12-18 15:26:59	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-18 15:27:19	_alex_w__	how tall are you marcus?
2017-12-18 15:27:30	@Marcus	like 6'1 1/2"
2017-12-18 15:27:36	@Marcus	or 6'1"
2017-12-18 15:27:40	@Marcus	since I'm shrinking
2017-12-18 15:27:44	@Marcus	I used to be 6'2"
2017-12-18 15:27:49	_alex_w__	you could have almost stand in mypearson 28
2017-12-18 15:28:21	@Marcus	I can almost stand in my boat too :)
2017-12-18 15:28:31	Mr_Bubs	that's the other reason I was asking, because you are tall
2017-12-18 15:28:36	_alex_w__	well, it was 6' headroom
2017-12-18 15:28:53	_alex_w__	a 6'2" friend who sailed with me a lot could stand just under the hatch, but nowhere else
2017-12-18 15:28:57	Mr_Bubs	and mornin' Alex

2017-12-18 15:44:18	@Marcus	I didn't know they made them boat sized
2017-12-18 15:44:36	ziper	I would still get one if I could be sure the outboard wouldnt fry it by charging wrong
2017-12-18 15:44:49	Mr_Bubs	I have a 5kw pack that I use for when the power goes out here at home
2017-12-18 15:45:12	Mr_Bubs	which is common as we get ice storms here in the winter

2017-12-18 16:15:49	ingmar_	mom looked like she was about to join the screaming
2017-12-18 16:15:53	_alex_w__	ziper: if you get a lfp battery you do need to figure out regulation for charging it from your outboard
2017-12-18 16:16:14	ziper	yeah, i dont think i will get one
2017-12-18 16:16:19	_alex_w__	outboard alternators usually aren't very well regulated, and it doesn't matter that much with lead acid batteries because the batteries are so big compared to the alternator's puny output

2017-12-18 16:19:55	@Marcus	that's a good price
2017-12-18 16:19:56	_alex_w__	those guys are great, we've bought a lot from them
2017-12-18 16:20:12	@Marcus	so I'm trying to figure out what I need for electrical...
2017-12-18 16:20:13	_alex_w__	they were very helpful when i put in the propane system
2017-12-18 16:20:37	_alex_w__	how much battery space do you have?
2017-12-18 16:20:49	@Marcus	house battery, starting battery, solar panel, refrig, ac to dc system, inverter, shore power
2017-12-18 16:20:54	_alex_w__	the ideal system is probably two group 27 or 31 deep cycle batteries for house loads, and a group 24 for starting the motor
2017-12-18 16:20:55	@Marcus	not much, space is at a premium
2017-12-18 16:21:29	_alex_w__	if space is at a premium then have two deep cycle batteries on an a/b switch that can you use both as house batteries and for starting the engine
2017-12-18 16:21:36	_alex_w__	and carry one of those lithium emergency starters
2017-12-18 16:21:52	_alex_w__	i don't suggest having a good inverter setup
2017-12-18 16:21:59	_alex_w__	if you make it awful then you won't use it and you'll save a lot of power
2017-12-18 16:22:18	@Marcus	I was thinking a small single plug inverter for when we have something that's 110 that needs to be plugged in
2017-12-18 16:22:21	<--	stoptouchingme (~stoptouch@unaffiliated/stoptouchingme) has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2017-12-18 16:22:23	@Marcus	I would like the boat to be 100% DC and self sustaining
2017-12-18 16:22:25	C3D2	_alex_w__: The high-tech route I see
2017-12-18 16:22:30	@Marcus	like... I wouldn't have shore power if I could avoid it
2017-12-18 16:22:39	@Marcus	but people recommend having it for shore charging just in case
2017-12-18 16:22:56	_alex_w__	yes, get shore power if you'll have a fridge
2017-12-18 16:23:05	_alex_w__	http://www.promariner.com/en/products/dry-mount-chargers
2017-12-18 16:23:10	_alex_w__	those are good, i've used them on both of my boats
2017-12-18 16:23:26	_alex_w__	the 15 or 20amp one is fine for a smaller battery bank and overnight charging
2017-12-18 16:23:32	C3D2	What's the general way of charging things like laptops when you're aboard? I presume boost/regulate to whatever input voltage the laptop takes and going from there?
2017-12-18 16:23:45	C3D2	While we're on the topic of power..
2017-12-18 16:23:48	_alex_w__	my recommendation with laptops is to get a dc charger for them
2017-12-18 16:23:58	_alex_w__	and also pick your laptops based on efficiency
2017-12-18 16:24:33	@Marcus	alex will this pronautic device handle the solar charging also?
2017-12-18 16:24:55	_alex_w__	a modern laptop that can run 12 hours on a charge is so much more efficient than a workstation replacement laptop from 3 years ago that only goes 2 hours on a charge with a battery 3x the size
2017-12-18 16:25:23	_alex_w__	Marcus: no, for that you should get the victron mppt https://www.amazon.com/Victron-SmartSolar-Charge-Controller-Bluetooth/dp/B075NQQRPD/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1513614312&sr=8-3&keywords=victron+mppt
2017-12-18 16:25:36	C3D2	But I love dragging around a pair of deep-cycle batteries for my computer!
2017-12-18 16:25:40	_alex_w__	75/15 will do 100w solar panel
2017-12-18 16:26:12	_alex_w__	C3D2: it's amazing how many people insist on cruising with 2 or 3 awful laptops
2017-12-18 16:27:04	@Marcus	do I need a battery monitor?
2017-12-18 16:27:16	@Marcus	and then once I have all this stuff, how do I hook it all up so it plays nice?
2017-12-18 16:27:19	_alex_w__	yes, one is a good idea.  i'd also get the victron for that
2017-12-18 16:27:37	_alex_w__	let me see if i have the old wiring diagram for my pearson online
2017-12-18 16:27:43	Mr_Bubs	Marcus, you call me and I come over for a weekend
2017-12-18 16:27:44	C3D2	_alex_w__: I don't doubt it
2017-12-18 16:28:26	Mr_Bubs	Marcus, if you send me your equipment list, I can make a diagram for you
2017-12-18 16:28:32	@Marcus	okay
2017-12-18 16:28:36	@Marcus	I'm still trying to figure out what I need
2017-12-18 16:28:47	_alex_w__	https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqokoOqNPTKZhh-dd3yOjNjV4_jz
2017-12-18 16:28:48	Mr_Bubs	I could even make a boat-shaped CAD drawing of it
2017-12-18 16:29:15	@Marcus	forgive my stupid
2017-12-18 16:29:24	@Marcus	what is the ~ with an arrow pointing at it?
2017-12-18 16:29:31	_alex_w__	fuse
2017-12-18 16:29:34	Mr_Bubs	fusible link?
2017-12-18 16:29:37	@Marcus	I just realized that after I looked at4 it
2017-12-18 16:29:40	@Marcus	derp
2017-12-18 16:29:43	Mr_Bubs	LOL
2017-12-18 16:30:10	_alex_w__	so i'd make a couple of changes, use a bluesea bcr instead of the echo charger if both batteries are teh same chemistry
2017-12-18 16:30:32	_alex_w__	but basically you run all 3 chargers in parallel to a charging bus, which is connected to the bcr
2017-12-18 16:30:39	_alex_w__	each battery is connected to a leg of the bcr
2017-12-18 16:30:53	_alex_w__	fuse or circuit breaker per load
2017-12-18 16:30:55	@Marcus	what does bcr stand for
2017-12-18 16:31:00	_alex_w__	battery charge relay
2017-12-18 16:31:12	@Marcus	also known as ACR?
2017-12-18 16:31:12	C3D2	Marcus: We all have those moments, I wouldn't worry
2017-12-18 16:31:14	_alex_w__	when there isa  charging load it connects the batteries together.  when there isn't they are indepedent
2017-12-18 16:31:18	_alex_w__	yeah
2017-12-18 16:31:55	_alex_w__	my setup there is a little unique in that i have two battery switches, one for house and one for the starter.  a more typical setup just has one switch and you go turn it after starting the battery
2017-12-18 16:32:10	_alex_w__	starting the engien i mean
2017-12-18 16:32:13	@Marcus	yeah
2017-12-18 16:32:19	@Marcus	I understood what you meant
2017-12-18 16:33:09	@Marcus	you have the alternator output going to both the charging circuit and the positive bus for the loads
2017-12-18 16:33:14	@Marcus	if I am reading this correctly
2017-12-18 16:33:38	_alex_w__	yeah, my circuit is a bit different because i used an echo charger
2017-12-18 16:33:38		[16:33]
2017-12-18 16:33:43	@Marcus	ah
2017-12-18 16:33:47	_alex_w__	so all charging and loads went to the positive of the house battery
2017-12-18 16:33:56	_alex_w__	and then the starter battery was charged from teh house circuit by the echo charger
2017-12-18 16:34:14	_alex_w__	i had to do that because my house and starter batteries ended up being different chemistries and wanting to be charged differently
2017-12-18 16:34:32	@Marcus	ah
2017-12-18 16:34:39	@Marcus	okay so I can simplify this a bit
2017-12-18 16:34:43	@Marcus	I gotta figure out where I can even fit batteries
2017-12-18 16:35:05	_alex_w__	where were they before?
2017-12-18 16:35:33	_alex_w__	agm or firefly batteries let you put them sideways, but cost a lot more (but the firefly battery has big advantages taht make teh cost worth considering)
2017-12-18 16:35:37	@Marcus	there's 2 compartments in the bilge above the ballast, I'm sure one had a battery in it
2017-12-18 16:36:24	Mr_Bubs	can you discharge the firefly as deep as a flooded cell?
2017-12-18 16:36:29	_alex_w__	a lot deeper
2017-12-18 16:36:39	_alex_w__	it can go 80%, a flooded should only go 50%
2017-12-18 16:36:43	@Marcus	whoa carbon foam agm
2017-12-18 16:36:50	@Marcus	sounds like something from star wars
2017-12-18 16:37:16	Mr_Bubs	6V golf cart batteries can go to 80%
2017-12-18 16:37:22	_alex_w__	they also handle partial charging better than any other lead acids, which is good for marcus' scenario
2017-12-18 16:37:29	_alex_w__	they won't last long if you go to 80%
2017-12-18 16:37:30	Mr_Bubs	dilithium crystals
2017-12-18 16:37:34	_alex_w__	look at the charge cycle graph
2017-12-18 16:37:42	@Marcus	damn these are not cheap
2017-12-18 16:37:53	_alex_w__	i warned you :)
2017-12-18 16:37:56	@Marcus	but a single oasis G31 is 110 ah
2017-12-18 16:38:08	_alex_w__	think in terms of usable capacity
2017-12-18 16:38:15	@Marcus	yeah, that's a lot of capacity
2017-12-18 16:38:21	_alex_w__	they are a little over 80ah usable (80% discharge)
2017-12-18 16:38:39	_alex_w__	a lead acid group31 is also around 110-120ah ultimate capacity, but only 50% usable for about 55ah
2017-12-18 16:38:56	@Marcus	80% though cuts your cycle life by 60%
2017-12-18 16:39:11	@Marcus	going to 50% gets you 3600 vs 1000 at 80%
2017-12-18 16:40:06	@Marcus	with a battery that big would I still need 2?
2017-12-18 16:40:30	_alex_w__	that's where you have to do a budget.  it's hard to know what your fridge load will be without knowing about your icebox size and insulation

2017-12-18 16:43:25	_alex_w__	that is the cycle graph for a 12v trojan agm, 500 cycles at 80%, 1000 cycles at 50%

2017-12-18 16:44:16	_alex_w__	golf cart one is better, 1200 cycles at 80%, 2000 at 50%
2017-12-18 16:44:32	@Dan-NS27	I put two Firefly's on my boat for house bank. So
2017-12-18 16:44:45	@Dan-NS27	Not much load on them right now.
2017-12-18 16:44:57	Mr_Bubs	mine seldom get discharged
2017-12-18 16:45:19	Mr_Bubs	but when we put the fridge in they will, when away from the slip
2017-12-18 16:45:36	@Dan-NS27	I just have the Airhead fan on full time. That's it so far
2017-12-18 16:45:53	ziper	is there any bad things about AGM compared to flooded
2017-12-18 16:46:01	_alex_w__	sealed batteries are recommended for offshore use (required for offshore racing)
2017-12-18 16:46:09	-->	stoptouchingme (~stoptouch@cpe-70-113-109-246.austin.res.rr.com) has joined ##sailing
2017-12-18 16:46:15	_alex_w__	ziper: they are much more sensitive to charging
2017-12-18 16:46:34	_alex_w__	specifically they don't handle being cooked by being charged at too high of a voltage
2017-12-18 16:46:34	Mr_Bubs	Alex, I've been meaning to ask you, will the norcold freeze or just refrigerate?
2017-12-18 16:46:55	_alex_w__	Mr_Bubs: it can only do one or theo ther, and using it to freeze would mean a tiny or very well insulated icebox
2017-12-18 16:47:03	_alex_w__	it doesn't have a freezer portion
2017-12-18 16:47:37	_alex_w__	Marcus: since you have a lot of high budget stuff going on i would put in two group 31 flooded 12v batteries for now, they'll be about $150 each
2017-12-18 16:47:47	@Marcus	hmmmm
2017-12-18 16:47:48	_alex_w__	then consider the firefly down the line
2017-12-18 16:47:49	@Marcus	okay
2017-12-18 16:47:51	@Marcus	if I have enough room
2017-12-18 16:47:56	@Marcus	you would put 2 fireflies in though?
2017-12-18 16:48:11	_alex_w__	well, you need to figure out your budget to really answer that question
2017-12-18 16:48:36	@Marcus	ok
2017-12-18 16:48:40	_alex_w__	if you have 200 watts of solar and usually have good sun then you'll be fine with 1
2017-12-18 16:48:40		[16:48]
2017-12-18 16:48:52	_alex_w__	if you have 100 watts of solar and have 5 days of clouds you'll probably want two
2017-12-18 16:48:57	@Marcus	I doubt I'll have 200w of solar, I don't have the real estate for a panel that big, I think
2017-12-18 16:49:06	_alex_w__	power consumption of the fridge depends more on your insulation than anything else
2017-12-18 16:49:32	@Marcus	well I'm building it, so I can get creative
2017-12-18 16:49:32	_alex_w__	you can run the engine to use the alternator to charge, but it's annoying
2017-12-18 16:49:46	_alex_w__	yeah, then maximize insulation thickness and quality
2017-12-18 16:49:58	ziper	do you have low voltage battery cutoffs
2017-12-18 16:50:17	_alex_w__	my fridge has one built in
2017-12-18 16:50:31	_alex_w__	that i think i have set to 11.5v, so that i can always start the engine
2017-12-18 16:50:44	_alex_w__	i don't for any other loads, since i don't have any other high amperage loads

2017-12-18 17:05:26	@Marcus	can you set it to frozen margarita?

2017-12-18 17:07:00	Mr_Bubs	indeed
2017-12-18 17:08:33	Mr_Bubs	my thought was to set it to freeze while in the slip and have a gallon jug of water in there
2017-12-18 17:09:10	Mr_Bubs	said frozen jug would keep things cold when we left the slip
2017-12-18 17:11:16	@Marcus	good idea
2017-12-18 17:11:16		[17:11]
2017-12-18 17:12:14	Mr_Bubs	fridge wouldn't have to run off the battery so much
2017-12-18 17:17:07	@Marcus	I gotta run down to the lumber store and get 2 sheets of 3/8 marine here before it snows so I can put the berths back in the boat
2017-12-18 17:17:29	@Marcus	although it's supposed to be sub freezing the entire week of xmas so I don';t know why I care, no way I'm working in the boat in below zero weather
2017-12-18 17:17:36	Mr_Bubs	ugh
2017-12-18 17:18:06	Mr_Bubs	nice you have a shop that has actual marine ply in stock
2017-12-18 17:18:27	Mr_Bubs	I found out that the local Menard's has Baltic birch plywood in stock
2017-12-18 17:24:00		[17:18]
2017-12-18 17:25:41	_alex_w__	Mr_Bubs: yes, it can free if there is enough insulation or the compartment is small enough
2017-12-18 17:25:54	_alex_w__	norcold recommends 3 cubic feet for freezers, 6 for fridges, but that all depends on insulation
2017-12-18 17:25:55	Mr_Bubs	cool.
2017-12-18 17:26:00	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-18 17:26:07	_alex_w__	my old boat had a 4 cubic foot fridge and it would freeze if i turned it cold enough
2017-12-18 17:26:29	Mr_Bubs	I have the galley out right now, so I can make it any size/shape I want
2017-12-18 17:26:47	_alex_w__	Marcus: run a heater in teh boat?  mine warms up pretty fast with one of those plug in radiators
2017-12-18 17:26:55	Mr_Bubs	and I'm replacing the two-burner stove with a single burner
2017-12-18 17:26:59	_alex_w__	but i guess if you are mostly doing woodwork that you'd be out of the boat a lot
2017-12-18 17:27:07	Mr_Bubs	as we never use 2 burners simultaneously
2017-12-18 17:27:17	_alex_w__	oh, we use both of ours for almost every meal
2017-12-18 17:27:34	@Marcus	_alex_w__: yeah it's just taking lumber in and out is going to cool it off pretty quick
2017-12-18 17:27:37	@Marcus	we'll see

2017-12-18 18:04:16		[18:04]
2017-12-18 18:04:29	Mr_Bubs	hey Mobes
2017-12-18 18:04:45	MobiusA	Hi Mr_Bubs
2017-12-18 18:05:05	Mr_Bubs	Marcus: R-values are smoke-and-mirrors
2017-12-18 18:05:33	MobiusA	Are you talking about insulation
2017-12-18 18:05:49	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-18 18:05:56	Mr_Bubs	shit, I gotta run an errand
2017-12-18 18:05:59	@Marcus	looking at k values
2017-12-18 18:06:06	MobiusA	Bye
2017-12-18 18:06:12	@Marcus	hi mobes
2017-12-18 18:06:21	MobiusA	Hi Marcus
2017-12-18 18:07:15	MobiusA	What are k values?
2017-12-18 18:07:20	Mr_Bubs	I'll bbl
2017-12-18 18:07:42	@Marcus	thermal transmission values
2017-12-18 18:07:56	@Marcus	so 5mm of aerogel z has the r value of 15
2017-12-18 18:08:25	@Marcus	sounds like this may be a great thing to insulate a freezer with
2017-12-18 18:08:26	@Marcus	http://www.buyaerogel.com/product/cryogel-z-5-mm-cut-to-size/
2017-12-18 18:09:23	MobiusA	What is the k value, so about 10 mm to to a freezer
2017-12-18 18:09:33	@Marcus	k value is .013
2017-12-18 18:10:56	MobiusA	Humm
2017-12-18 18:11:24	@Marcus	supposedly thickness in inches divided by k value gives you r value
2017-12-18 18:12:06	MobiusA	How do you attached it, I have not read the link in full
2017-12-18 18:13:06	@Marcus	glue, i'd imagine
2017-12-18 18:13:14	@Marcus	I have to build a freezer box for my boat, or insulat the one that's tehre
2017-12-18 18:13:25	@Marcus	so I'm looking around for good solutions that don't require 6" of thickness
2017-12-18 18:13:44	MobiusA	This is looking good then
2017-12-18 18:14:21	@Marcus	kind of pricey but probably worth it
2017-12-18 18:14:43	MobiusA	Keep me posted haha
2017-12-18 18:14:50	@Marcus	will do
2017-12-18 18:15:33	MobiusA	I am having a rigging guy look at my boat
2017-12-18 18:16:12	@Marcus	inspection or fixes?
2017-12-18 18:16:38	MobiusA	And adding insulation to my ice box would be a major chore
2017-12-18 18:17:06	MobiusA	Replacement, as it is the OEM equipment

2017-12-18 18:55:43	_alex_w__	at laest you aren't going farther west, i5 is closed in wa from the train accident this morning
2017-12-18 18:55:49	@Dan-NS27	Looks like I'll be getting a small table saw later this week. Guy at work wanted to get rid of his.

2017-12-18 18:56:19	Mr_Bubs	I was trailering my boat through chicago, highway under contruction, missed my exit and it put me 2 hours out of the way

2017-12-18 18:56:50	_alex_w__	first day of a new route, it looks like the train operator was maybe going too fast?
2017-12-18 18:56:57	CalebD_	train fell off a trestle onto the highway I5
2017-12-18 18:56:57	_alex_w__	train derailed onto i5
2017-12-18 18:57:06	@Dan-NS27	Wow
2017-12-18 18:57:07	Mr_Bubs	that seems to be what happens a lot when they derail
2017-12-18 18:57:37	MobiusA	That’s messed up
2017-12-18 18:57:38	_alex_w__	if you look at the map of the location it is a long straight away then a curve over the highway
2017-12-18 18:57:53	_alex_w__	the crazy part is that i've only ridden my bicycle on one section of i5, and it's right there
2017-12-18 18:58:05	MobiusA	How many cars derailed?
2017-12-18 18:58:16	_alex_w__	(it's about the only place that you can't get around on surface roads without going 10 miles out of your way)
2017-12-18 18:58:32	_alex_w__	looked like 4 or 5?  it was a passenger train
2017-12-18 18:58:48	_alex_w__	i think current estimates are 6 dead and 70 or more in hospitals
2017-12-18 18:59:01	MobiusA	Damn they all fell to the road ?
2017-12-18 18:59:10	CalebD_	It was the first day of a new route Alex ?

2017-12-18 19:16:02	@Marcus	I dunno, there's a lot of trust fund kids out here who are idiots
2017-12-18 19:16:06	@Marcus	esp in vail area
2017-12-18 19:17:08	ziper	they can afford maids
2017-12-18 19:17:42	_alex_w__	i work and lead a lot of millenials and am friends with others.  i don't think they are fundementally more flawed than gen-x, despite popular opinion
2017-12-18 19:18:08	_alex_w__	i manage people who are between 22 and 42 years old
2017-12-18 19:18:17	@Marcus	_alex_w__: you work at MS, the hiring practices there probably weed out the true idiots
2017-12-18 19:18:35	_alex_w__	well, i'm friends with a lot of them too.  there are true idiots in every generation.
2017-12-18 19:18:46	_alex_w__	most of my friends are 5-10 years younger than me
2017-12-18 19:21:08	_alex_w__	i'm not saying every millenial is an angel, just that on average they seem similar to gen-x (also lots of idiots and lots of smart people)
2017-12-18 19:21:17	@Marcus	maybe it's just the internet makes things like this more visible
2017-12-18 19:21:27	_alex_w__	yes, i think that is certainly true
2017-12-18 19:21:50	_alex_w__	and i do think that overtime people have gotten too sensitive to critical feedback or failure
2017-12-18 19:22:07	_alex_w__	i think regular failure is part of success
2017-12-18 19:22:14	_alex_w__	that's how you grow

2017-12-18 21:08:11	@Bill-Rangatira	a CM 1200? and a farr30
2017-12-18 21:08:20	@Bill-Rangatira	yes
2017-12-18 21:08:37	_alex_w__	on jack rabbit i expect that you'd be starting as the least experienced person and spending more time on the rail, but it's also really fun to be on a competitively sailed boat and learn from people racing for a long time
2017-12-18 21:08:49	_alex_w__	i didn't know that they were out of your club.
2017-12-18 21:09:08	@Bill-Rangatira	they have a crew of 8 on jack rabbit
2017-12-18 21:09:23	_alex_w__	farr 30 crew should be 5 or 6
2017-12-18 21:09:40	_alex_w__	both are going to be more athletic than the newport
2017-12-18 21:09:50	@Bill-Rangatira	yes they run the far 30 nwith 4
2017-12-18 21:09:57	_alex_w__	you should do races with both and see how you like the groups

2017-12-18 21:10:12	_alex_w__	don't commit to anyone seriously yet, just spend time getting rides
2017-12-18 21:10:20	@Bill-Rangatira	i think so
2017-12-18 21:10:51	_alex_w__	the way that i'd figure out when to commit is when a skipper asked me to do a big race (like round the county or swiftsure)
2017-12-18 21:10:55	@Bill-Rangatira	just glad to be free of the high maintenance skipper
2017-12-18 21:11:04	_alex_w__	then i'd do a bunch of races leading up to get to know everyone and the boat
2017-12-18 21:11:39	_alex_w__	otherwise i always was a bit of a free floater on multiple boats before getting my own

2017-12-18 21:14:57	_alex_w__	so i ended up only doing little fun races on my boat, nothing serious
2017-12-18 21:15:21	_alex_w__	now with the express i have my girlfriend as a partner, which makes it a lot more fun because i still get to do all of the jobs
2017-12-18 21:16:33	ingmar_	the expensive bit is certainly true :)
2017-12-18 21:17:11	ingmar_	rigger's favorite customers were all the racers, because they needed replacement poles and one time a whole new rig, and usually in a hurry and costs be damned.
2017-12-18 21:17:45	_alex_w__	the sail makers get even more money

2017-12-18 21:19:52	ingmar_	the better ones had sponsors though, and good insurance that would pay out when they broke shit racing too hard

2017-12-18 21:20:25	_alex_w__	more than two years, most of the top boats here budget one to two sails a per year, and have 4-10 sails in their inventory
2017-12-18 21:20:43	_alex_w__	the most competitive classes here have a one sail per year rule
2017-12-18 21:21:16	_alex_w__	my hardest working sail is my #1, and it was designed to get about 5-6 years of use with regular racing
2017-12-18 21:21:30	_alex_w__	but that is still $1000/year
2017-12-18 21:21:57	ingmar_	that's why they can only afford to sail a few hours a week ;)

2017-12-18 21:46:03	_alex_w__	ingmar_: hah.  some laminate sails fail more from age than use
2017-12-18 21:46:42	_alex_w__	and newer designs are lasting a long time.  i've read (but don't know for sure) that a lot of the volvo ocean race teams as using their same mains for this race as the last one
2017-12-18 21:46:56	_alex_w__	two circumnavigations on one sail is pretty good by any metric
2017-12-18 21:51:01	@Marcus	we beat the shit out of the finn sails and they're great
2017-12-18 21:51:08	@Marcus	in between races we sit in tthe boats and let the flog like mad

2017-12-19 17:48:33	Mr_Bubs	I was going to, until we did the math and since I wasn't make a hundred of them it cost about the same for him to just buy the mantus

2017-12-19 17:56:25	_alex_w__	i heard from my yard yesterday, the blisters on my boat are in the barrier coat
2017-12-19 17:56:48	ingmar_	isn't that ironic
2017-12-19 17:56:50	_alex_w__	yup
2017-12-19 17:56:52	_alex_w__	i
2017-12-19 17:56:57	_alex_w__	'm also not sure why it has a barrier coat
2017-12-19 17:57:12	ingmar_	what's under the barrier coat, gelcoat or fibreglass?
2017-12-19 17:57:38	_alex_w__	i think a thin layer of gelcoat, and then epoxy-based (not polyester based) fiberglass
2017-12-19 17:58:50	ingmar_	hm, if the gelcoat under the blisters is okay, you can just leave it. unless it's causing your antifouling to come off
2017-12-19 17:59:11	ziper	why would they put gelcoat on epoxy
2017-12-19 17:59:19	_alex_w__	ziper: finish
2017-12-19 17:59:26	ingmar_	tricky to sell a boat with any kind of blistering though. people tend to freak out.
2017-12-19 17:59:32	ziper	why not just prime and paint
2017-12-19 17:59:36	_alex_w__	ingmar_: the blisters aren't a durability problem, they are a slowing us down problem
2017-12-19 17:59:45	ingmar_	ziper: because gelcoat is way more durable
2017-12-19 17:59:47	_alex_w__	they are coming off
2017-12-19 17:59:52	ingmar_	oh, ok. that sucks then
2017-12-19 18:00:08	_alex_w__	there are a couple thousand 3mm ones
2017-12-19 18:00:19	ingmar_	that really sucks then.
2017-12-19 18:00:39	_alex_w__	i knew this buying hte boat, and i knew it probably wasn't in the hull because it didn't have the vinegar smell
2017-12-19 18:00:50	_alex_w__	and we got the price of the boat dropped by about what this removal is going to cost us
2017-12-19 18:00:56	ingmar_	ah, cool
2017-12-19 18:01:05	_alex_w__	so overall i'm happy
2017-12-19 18:01:14	ingmar_	how are you going to strip it? blasting?
2017-12-19 18:01:36	_alex_w__	the yard is getting back to me with a proposal

2017-12-19 18:02:57	CalebD_	blisters be damned
2017-12-19 18:03:58	CalebD_	I guess there was a problem with the original barrier coat then, the way it was applied or cured
2017-12-19 18:05:17	_alex_w__	yeah, it's just kind of ironic because the boat is built in a way that shouldn't need a barrier coat, and the barrier coat is what caused the blisters
2017-12-19 18:05:27	_alex_w__	so someone wasted money applying it, and now i'm paying again to remove it
2017-12-19 18:06:11	CalebD_	there a various blasting techniques that should take it off:  soda blasting, walnut shells etc
2017-12-19 18:07:41	_alex_w__	i don't know how often those are used around here since they have to fully contain it
2017-12-19 18:07:52	_alex_w__	you can't have any copper dust going into the air
2017-12-19 18:08:25	_alex_w__	i assume the yard has done this before and it'll just be some boat bux

2017-12-19 18:17:42	_alex_w__	ingmar_: i just haven't seen it done here
2017-12-19 18:18:07	_alex_w__	it seems like the more common approach is to use a gelcoat planer that can cut off a thin layer
2017-12-19 18:19:22	svm_invictvs	Barrier coat isn't necessarY/
2017-12-19 18:21:09	_alex_w__	it depends on how your boat is made
2017-12-19 18:21:32	_alex_w__	barrier coat is basically a thin layer of epoxy, to keep water from getting into polyester-based gelcoat and fiberglass layups
2017-12-19 18:21:51	_alex_w__	my boat is made of epoxy, so there is really extra that the barrier coat is doing
2017-12-19 18:21:55	@Bill-Rangatira	isn't your boat epoxy ;ayup?
2017-12-19 18:22:10	_alex_w__	most boats are made of polyester, so a barrier coat is helpful with those
2017-12-19 18:22:15	@Bill-Rangatira	err layup ... ok
2017-12-19 18:23:43	@Bill-Rangatira	west makes a barrier additive for epoxy as well i wonder why that is
2017-12-19 18:23:43		[18:23]
2017-12-19 18:24:46	@Bill-Rangatira	https://www.westsystem.com/422-barrier-coat-additive/
2017-12-19 18:25:37	@Marcus	I'm trying to figure out if I should barrier coat my boat before it goes in the water
2017-12-19 18:25:45	@Marcus	right now the hull has been out of the water for ever and it's dry as hell
2017-12-19 18:25:56	@Marcus	figure if I barrier coated it now it might s tay that way
2017-12-19 18:30:36	CalebD_	I would think your Marieholm was built with a polyester slurry like many production boats in those days

2017-12-19 18:47:42	_alex_w__	assuming it isn't cost prohibative
2017-12-19 18:48:15	Mr_Bubs	I'm curious what my boat is gonna look like when I pull it out.
2017-12-19 18:48:27	Mr_Bubs	it just has rustoleum on it
2017-12-19 18:48:30	_alex_w__	Bill-Rangatira: i'm not sure about 422 either, but they also say it is only for poly boats

2017-12-19 19:04:22	@Dan-NS27	Marcus, I'd do a barrier coat on your boat. I'll do one on mine once I strip it down.
2017-12-19 19:04:41	@Dan-NS27	Alex, I thought your boat was made with vinylester.
2017-12-19 19:05:00	Mr_Bubs	OHSA yellow is a good color for barrier coat, Marcus
2017-12-19 19:06:23	@Dan-NS27	Mr_Bubs, that's a good color to paint your hull.
2017-12-19 19:06:53	Mr_Bubs	LOL
2017-12-19 19:07:40	@Dan-NS27	At least the unfavorable Mac's
2017-12-19 19:07:58	@Dan-NS27	"stay away!"
2017-12-19 19:08:24	Mr_Bubs	there's a guy here that has a mac26.
2017-12-19 19:08:40	Mr_Bubs	funny thing is, those "wrap-around" windows aren't windows at all
2017-12-19 19:08:47	Mr_Bubs	just black paint
2017-12-19 19:09:11	@Dan-NS27	LOL
2017-12-19 19:09:34	CalebD_	not all Mac 26's are "bad"
2017-12-19 19:09:34		[19:09]
2017-12-19 19:09:43	Mr_Bubs	anyway, he repainted his boat one color.
2017-12-19 19:09:43	Mr_Bubs	http://sailboatdata.com/viewrecord.asp?class_id=4092
2017-12-19 19:10:03	Mr_Bubs	he has that one.  But it looks normal without the faux windows
2017-12-19 19:10:15	Mr_Bubs	but damn that bitch has some freeboard
2017-12-19 19:10:32	Mr_Bubs	shit ton of room in it, though
2017-12-19 19:10:54	@Dan-NS27	Trying to make it look like a big luxury yacht?
2017-12-19 19:11:01	CalebD_	the cabin on the M26 "S" is quite large too - just no standing room
2017-12-19 19:11:25	Mr_Bubs	the 26D you can do jumping jacks in with 6 other people
2017-12-19 19:12:12	Lnk	why would you want a boat that big without a weighted keel?
2017-12-19 19:12:24	CalebD_	water ballast
2017-12-19 19:12:48	Lnk	what's the benefit of that
2017-12-19 19:12:58	_alex_w__	Dan-NS27: acrylic modified epoxy
2017-12-19 19:13:03	_alex_w__	is what my boat uses
2017-12-19 19:13:08	CalebD_	ballast
2017-12-19 19:13:09	@Dan-NS27	ah ok
2017-12-19 19:13:18	_alex_w__	lnk: to make it lighter for trailering
2017-12-19 19:13:25	Lnk	oh
2017-12-19 19:13:29	@Dan-NS27	^^
2017-12-19 19:13:31	_alex_w__	that's the only reason for ballastless boats like the mac
2017-12-19 19:13:48	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-19 19:14:03	_alex_w__	water ballast is also used in race boats, but it is very different.  they put tanks up by the gunwales and you pump to the high side to flatten the boat
2017-12-19 19:14:05	@Dan-NS27	Light weight tow vehicles
2017-12-19 19:14:16	_alex_w__	let's you get away with less railmeat
2017-12-19 19:14:23	@Dan-NS27	Interesting Alex
2017-12-19 19:14:48	singlerider	_alex_w__: a water ballast? Like a bilge? :D
2017-12-19 19:15:05	@Dan-NS27	Time to go take care of the little one. I'll be in and out.
2017-12-19 19:15:07	singlerider	I wouldn't mind a side bilge
2017-12-19 19:16:10	Mr_Bubs	it's a compromise
2017-12-19 19:16:22	Mr_Bubs	the water ballast, that is
2017-12-19 19:16:55	CalebD_	they can be quite tender if you forget to fill the water ballast
2017-12-19 19:17:19	Mr_Bubs	the mac26D doesn't sail all that great
2017-12-19 19:17:29	Mr_Bubs	at least, the one I was on didnt
2017-12-19 19:17:39	CalebD_	the "D" is the dagger board version ?
2017-12-19 19:17:47	Mr_Bubs	er, 26M
2017-12-19 19:18:01	Mr_Bubs	the D sails fine, there's one next to me at the marina
2017-12-19 19:18:12	CalebD_	the "D" & "S" (centerboard) aren't bad sailors
2017-12-19 19:18:19	Mr_Bubs	no
2017-12-19 19:18:28	Mr_Bubs	"M" is the motor-sailer
2017-12-19 19:18:33	CalebD_	the "X" & "M" have a 50 HP wart sitting on the transom
2017-12-19 19:18:47	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-19 19:18:51	CalebD_	and are fugly as hell
2017-12-19 19:19:07	Mr_Bubs	yeah.  like I said, the guy with one here repainted it
2017-12-19 19:19:13	Mr_Bubs	it looks a lot better
2017-12-19 19:19:25	Mr_Bubs	but still doesn't sail well
2017-12-19 19:19:26	CalebD_	got rid of the double sunglasses ?
2017-12-19 19:19:42	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-19 19:20:33	Mr_Bubs	the Hunter Edge looks worse, IMO:
2017-12-19 19:20:36	Mr_Bubs	https://www.sailmagazine.com/.image/t_share/MTQ4OTg4MTE5NzMxNDc5NjA3/hunter_edge_diagram.jpg
2017-12-19 19:20:49	Mr_Bubs	that's Hunter's version of the 26X/M
2017-12-19 19:22:02	Mr_Bubs	it looks like a sneaker
2017-12-19 19:22:08	Mr_Bubs	like a shoe
2017-12-19 19:22:32	CalebD_	yup, that is a stinker too
2017-12-19 19:22:48	CalebD_	very fugly
2017-12-19 19:24:21	Mr_Bubs	you can also put a bowsprit and a shitload of furlers on it:
2017-12-19 19:24:24	Mr_Bubs	http://photobucket.com/gallery/user/maccutter19/media/cGF0aDpTcGlubmFrZXIgbWFjY3V0dGVyMTkvTWVhZm9yZCBIYXJib3VyL0RTQ04xNDA2LmpwZw==/?ref=
2017-12-19 19:25:31	Mr_Bubs	that's like $4K in furlers on a $2K boat
2017-12-19 19:25:31		[19:25]
2017-12-19 19:26:54	_alex_w__	and they couldn't roll up their genoa properly, so it isgetting sunburnt
2017-12-19 19:27:23	Mr_Bubs	that's actually a macgregor 19, which is the weirdest boat Roger ever designed
2017-12-19 19:27:24	_alex_w__	they are probably cheap cdi furlers, so maybe not that expensive
2017-12-19 19:27:57	Mr_Bubs	it's a stubby little bitch with the oddest cabin
2017-12-19 19:28:39	_alex_w__	whoa, double quarterberth on a 19' boat
2017-12-19 19:28:49	Mr_Bubs	HUGH double berth under the cockpit, a head you can stand up and shower in, and the galley is in the V
2017-12-19 19:29:26	_alex_w__	it's basically a bayliner with a mast
2017-12-19 19:29:31	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-19 19:29:39	Mr_Bubs	fish-n-ski-sail
2017-12-19 19:29:42	Mr_Bubs	n
2017-12-19 19:31:46	PaulinS	hey hey
2017-12-19 19:31:59	Mr_Bubs	Hi Paul
2017-12-19 19:33:14	PaulinS	Hi Mr B
2017-12-19 19:33:36	Mr_Bubs	how are things?
2017-12-19 19:34:11	PaulinS	so so, you?
2017-12-19 19:34:16	Mr_Bubs	meh
2017-12-19 19:34:24	Mr_Bubs	need some time off work.
2017-12-19 19:34:34	Mr_Bubs	you find a new job yet?
2017-12-19 19:34:39	_alex_w__	i'm doing 11 performance reviews in 2 days for work
2017-12-19 19:34:41	PaulinS	nope
2017-12-19 19:34:46	Mr_Bubs	looking?
2017-12-19 19:34:57	Mr_Bubs	or just chillin' until after the holidays?
2017-12-19 19:35:02	_alex_w__	trying to write them all for my old team while i can
2017-12-19 19:36:06	PaulinS	looking, have a couple of calls to make
2017-12-19 19:36:20	Mr_Bubs	I hate that
2017-12-19 19:37:01	PaulinS	doubt anything will come of it, but you never know
2017-12-19 19:37:12	PaulinS	both with good sized companies, neither is an advertised position
2017-12-19 19:37:58	_alex_w__	i was just wondering how many medium to large employers there are in victoria
2017-12-19 19:38:24	PaulinS	a surprising amount, Victoria is a bit of a tech hub
2017-12-19 19:38:30	_alex_w__	my team actually started from an acquisition of a victoria based company, but that was 25 years ago
2017-12-19 19:38:41	_alex_w__	that's cool because it seems like a great place to live
2017-12-19 19:38:45	PaulinS	plus the provincial government is based here, so lots goes on around them
2017-12-19 19:39:52	_alex_w__	the wa state gov't is in olympia, but there isn't much besides gov't work there
2017-12-19 19:40:12	_alex_w__	well, and this week, there is a derailled train on the interstate
2017-12-19 19:40:16	PaulinS	lots of big multinationals have at least some sort of presence here
2017-12-19 19:40:51	_alex_w__	olympia being an hour from seattle probably makes less happen in olympia.  where you have 3 hours of water in between victoria and vancouver
2017-12-19 19:40:51		[19:40]
2017-12-19 19:43:50	PaulinS	ooh, orca in the harbour, I might go have a look
2017-12-19 19:49:00		[19:43]
2017-12-19 20:29:59	@Dan-NS27	Had to get the dryer vents cleaned out. Someone came by today to do it but we find out some wall cap is crushed and couldn't be done.
2017-12-19 20:29:59		[20:29]
2017-12-19 20:31:10	Mr_Bubs	ever if I love my ventless dryer
2017-12-19 20:31:37	Mr_Bubs	well, washer/dryer combo
2017-12-19 20:33:02	singlerider	Dan-NS27: are you finally retired?
2017-12-19 20:33:15	singlerider	Have you started your life of leisure?
2017-12-19 20:34:10	_alex_w__	the wall cap is pretty trivial to replace
2017-12-19 20:34:19	_alex_w__	but i guess if it is a rental they probably don't want you doing it
2017-12-19 20:34:31	_alex_w__	i just put in a new washer/dryer at my mother in law's
2017-12-19 20:35:24	Mr_Bubs	https://www.westmarine.com/buy/westland--7100xc-ventless-ac-washer-dryer-combo--10706117?cm_mmc=PS-_-Google-_-Dynamic%2520Search%2520Ads%2520-_-Null&adpos=1t1&creative=239384124188&device=c&matchtype=b&network=g&mrkgadid=2998078339&mrkgcl=481&rkg_id=h-0e618ad4d8d5b9d19a7de5e73ff043ab_t-1513715488&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1r_ny_WW2AIVWbXACh0iJQKFEAAYASAAEgL9V_D_BwE
2017-12-19 20:36:35	CalebD_	Mr_Bubs : you have that model washer/dryer in your home?
2017-12-19 20:37:08	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-19 20:37:15	Mr_Bubs	we've had it not quite a year
2017-12-19 20:37:17	Mr_Bubs	but I love it
2017-12-19 20:37:49	_alex_w__	how does a condensor dryer work?
2017-12-19 20:38:19	_alex_w__	it's basically running an ac and collecting condensate from the water in the dryer's atmosphere?
2017-12-19 20:38:38	Mr_Bubs	I'm not exactly sure
2017-12-19 20:38:50	Mr_Bubs	it's only a 110v unit
2017-12-19 20:39:13	Mr_Bubs	but the clothes are warm just like out of a traditional dryer
2017-12-19 20:39:41	Mr_Bubs	and the drain pump kicks on during the dry cycle
2017-12-19 20:40:07	_alex_w__	cool
2017-12-19 20:40:26	Mr_Bubs	here's a tip on that machine, though
2017-12-19 20:40:26	_alex_w__	i don't think we could ever do a single washer/dryer unit nwo that we have a kid
2017-12-19 20:40:33	_alex_w__	but it's neat to know about
2017-12-19 20:40:56	Mr_Bubs	set it to "less dry" and remove the clothes as soon as the cycle is done
2017-12-19 20:41:00	CalebD_	and makes a lot of sense for a boat installation
2017-12-19 20:41:06	Mr_Bubs	otherwise they can be wrinkly
2017-12-19 20:41:12	@Dan-NS27	singlerider, a couple signatures on Thursday and final sign out next week, 27th, and that's it.
2017-12-19 20:41:29	Mr_Bubs	it doesn't use hardly any water, soap, or electricity
2017-12-19 20:41:36	CalebD_	whoa Dan, so by years end it will be official ?
2017-12-19 20:41:47	_alex_w__	yeah, i've been using a front loader for 20 years, which is true on all of those things for the washer
2017-12-19 20:41:54	Mr_Bubs	but the load size is smaller, and the wash/dry cycle is longer
2017-12-19 20:42:08	_alex_w__	i've had to repair it a couple of times, but it keeps on going
2017-12-19 20:42:44	@Dan-NS27	Caleb, yes
2017-12-19 20:43:09	CalebD_	fantastic
2017-12-19 20:43:22	@Dan-NS27	Then I'll have three months before the pay gets cut
2017-12-19 20:44:59	@Dan-NS27	singlerider, not sure I'd call it a life of leisure at this time.
2017-12-19 20:44:59		[20:44]
2017-12-19 20:45:35	singlerider	Dan-NS27: you have three months of terminal leave?
2017-12-19 20:45:45	singlerider	I had 60 days - the maximum at the time
2017-12-19 20:45:47	@Dan-NS27	Mr_Bubs, I had a ventless dryer in Germany. It was nice.
2017-12-19 20:46:28	@Dan-NS27	singlerider, 75 days of leave and 20 days of Permissive TDY
2017-12-19 20:49:00	@Dan-NS27	P-TDY is supposed to be extra days set aside to look for work, move, or getting ready for whatever's next
2017-12-19 20:49:30	singlerider	oh right
2017-12-19 20:49:41	singlerider	I've already been out for five years. I forget things
2017-12-19 20:49:56	@Dan-NS27	Don't blame you
2017-12-19 20:50:06	@Dan-NS27	I'm sure I will forget things very quickly
2017-12-19 20:52:02	@Dan-NS27	Will be nice to call my dad and tell him I'm done
2017-12-19 20:52:37	Mr_Bubs	I forget stuff I don't need to know
2017-12-19 20:52:55	Mr_Bubs	for example, I doubt I could pass the tech exam right now
2017-12-19 20:53:21	@Dan-NS27	LOL, I feel the same
2017-12-19 20:53:51	@Dan-NS27	I got it, so all I need to do is renew.
2017-12-19 20:54:30	Mr_Bubs	I know 1) which frequencies I can use, 2) how to make antennas, and 3) don't say "fuck" on the radio.  That's about it
2017-12-19 20:55:09	@Dan-NS27	Hahaha

2017-12-19 23:54:45	Lnk	that's about 100' from me but ironically like a 30 minute walk
2017-12-19 23:55:05	singlerider	Yup
2017-12-19 23:55:21	singlerider	It's downwind, which makes parking easier
2017-12-19 23:55:27	Lnk	easier?
2017-12-19 23:55:38	singlerider	I think so, yes, in a shared slip
2017-12-19 23:55:40	Lnk	usually you want an upwind slip
2017-12-19 23:55:45	Lnk	i'd much rather an upwind slip
2017-12-19 23:56:20	singlerider	Lnk: why?
2017-12-19 23:56:30	singlerider	I like the help turning in
2017-12-19 23:56:44	singlerider	I don't maneuver well at low speed
2017-12-19 23:57:28	Lnk	much more complicated to sail into a slip downwind
2017-12-19 23:57:38	Lnk	even under motor, harder to slow down when downwind
2017-12-19 23:57:47	_alex_w__	and even if motoring, if things are bad going forward, it's even worse when going in reverse
2017-12-19 23:57:50	Lnk	having an upwind slip helps you out of the slip when leaving, too
2017-12-19 23:58:00	_alex_w__	and in reverse you won't have the wind pushing your bow down to make the turn
2017-12-19 23:58:00		[23:58]
2017-12-19 23:58:30	singlerider	Maybe I should clarify
2017-12-19 23:58:42	singlerider	It pushes me into the dock on my beam
2017-12-19 23:59:08	_alex_w__	oh, i thought you meant the stern was facing the wind
2017-12-19 23:59:09	Lnk	that'd be a sidewind slip :)
2017-12-19 23:59:19	singlerider	You're a sidewind slip >:O

2017-12-19 23:59:33	Lnk	wind in berkeley is normally out of the west, so slips are pretty up or down wid

2017-12-20 00:02:58	singlerider	elektron: I was in reverse most of the way down the channel to K dock
2017-12-20 00:03:40	singlerider	Getting out of that slip was a whole ordeal. A marina worker got in a small motorboat and pushed up against me so I could turn without smacking the overhang

2017-12-20 15:46:40	_alex_w__	we used to use an insulated mug full of almost boiling water to warm bottles of breast milk

2017-12-20 15:51:08	_alex_w__	you can see the location there
2017-12-20 15:51:14	@marcus	but c9ould probably rig something in the back of the cockpit
2017-12-20 15:51:26	_alex_w__	yeah, it doesn't need to be in cubby, it can just be under the tiller
2017-12-20 15:51:30	@marcus	damn that boat is big
2017-12-20 15:51:50	@marcus	alex, if this isn't too pushy, some time I'd like to come to seattle and race with you, maybe a distance race
2017-12-20 15:51:50		[15:51]
2017-12-20 15:52:23	_alex_w__	yeah, i'm sure we can make that happen.  i don't know what our distance racing schedule is going to look like this year due to having a baby
2017-12-20 15:52:30	@marcus	yeah I understand
2017-12-20 15:52:36	_alex_w__	kerry and i haven't talked about anything post wedding
2017-12-20 15:52:51	_alex_w__	but the boat is getting a fresh new bottom, and we wouldn't be investing in that if we weren't going to race
2017-12-20 15:52:55	@marcus	maybe a regatta, like 2 days or something, so the trip gets more sailing in
2017-12-20 15:53:18	@Bill-Rangatira	come up for swiftsure?
2017-12-20 15:53:28	_alex_w__	i'm pretty sure we aren't doing swiftsure this year
2017-12-20 15:53:37	@Bill-Rangatira	ah too bad
2017-12-20 15:53:45	@marcus	or next year, just some time
2017-12-20 15:53:46	_alex_w__	i might do it on lodos (a j/109), but it's a 6 day event and i don't think i can do that
2017-12-20 15:54:17	_alex_w__	but tri-island has some long races, i'll let you know if we decide to do those this year
2017-12-20 15:54:25	ingmar_	marcus: we have two canvas/mesh cup holders with suction cups stuck to the binnacle. they work surprisingly well.
2017-12-20 15:54:42	_alex_w__	binnacles make cup holders in the cockpit trivial

2017-12-20 16:07:32		[16:07]
2017-12-20 16:08:26	_alex_w__	i have some lifeline ones, but they are kind of annoying and get in the way when racing
2017-12-20 16:08:43	_alex_w__	now we just have the 4 back there, and a bungie at the mast for people on the foredeck
2017-12-20 16:09:31	_alex_w__	that cubby is awesome to have, just to throw things into when you need to get them out of the way quickly
2017-12-20 16:10:32	ingmar_	yeah, it is. we have no cockpit storage area, so i got this waterproof-ish fishermans bag and put all the things in there (binoculars, handbearing compass, flashlights, etc.)
2017-12-20 16:10:45	ingmar_	has the advantage that when you're going away, you just put the whole bag below and everything is safe.
2017-12-20 16:12:25	_alex_w__	yeah, the downside of the cubby is that it accumulates things
2017-12-20 16:12:34	_alex_w__	especially weirdo hardware and tethers
2017-12-20 16:13:19	ingmar_	hehe, the bag does that too. just tidied it up this morning
2017-12-20 16:13:44	@Bill-Rangatira	found a part in my box o'junk wondering what it may have been for
2017-12-20 16:13:48	@Bill-Rangatira	https://imgur.com/a/H6Bnh
2017-12-20 16:14:17	_alex_w__	looks like parts from an autopilot
2017-12-20 16:14:45	_alex_w__	for connecting the ram to a tiller or wheel
2017-12-20 16:14:55	@Bill-Rangatira	hmm for a tiller pilot
2017-12-20 16:15:20	_alex_w__	the stud can also go on the bottom of a wheel (though not on your boat since your wheel doesn't maintain a fixed position relative to the rudder)
2017-12-20 16:16:14	@Bill-Rangatira	yes my thoughts as well
2017-12-20 16:16:46	_alex_w__	it could also be to integrate a ram with the quadrant below decks
2017-12-20 16:17:04	@Bill-Rangatira	not sure maybe it could be a tiller extension for the emergency tiller
2017-12-20 16:17:06	_alex_w__	that might be more likely with that large diameter machine thread

2017-12-20 16:19:02	@Bill-Rangatira	oh the steering ram for my boat is a double ended piston
2017-12-20 16:19:19	_alex_w__	Bill-Rangatira: i meant an autopilot ram
2017-12-20 16:19:21	@Bill-Rangatira	and the steering arm is in the middle
2017-12-20 16:19:28	_alex_w__	i assume you are talking about the hydraulic ram
2017-12-20 16:19:32	@Bill-Rangatira	yes
2017-12-20 16:19:46	_alex_w__	but i guess on your boat the autopilot would be a hydraulic pump?
2017-12-20 16:19:57	_alex_w__	i've never seen hydraulic steering
2017-12-20 16:20:07	_alex_w__	it's a bit of a mystery to me why you have it
2017-12-20 16:20:10	@Bill-Rangatira	i would say so but at the moment i have no auto pilot
2017-12-20 16:21:36	@Bill-Rangatira	i might just put it on my windvane for a remote steering and a tiller pilot
2017-12-20 16:22:00	@Bill-Rangatira	i can steer the boat with the windvane rudder
2017-12-20 16:23:57	Mr_Bubs	what windvane do you have?

2017-12-20 16:25:48	C3D2	I just can't wrap my head around it, I guess I'll just have to wait and either have a look at one in the real world or accept that I won't get it
2017-12-20 16:26:40	Mr_Bubs	the windvane?
2017-12-20 16:26:45	C3D2	Yup
2017-12-20 16:26:57	Mr_Bubs	they are actually very simple
2017-12-20 16:27:15	@marcus	super simple
2017-12-20 16:27:55	C3D2	I think I just had an epiphanous moment
2017-12-20 16:27:55	@Bill-Rangatira	the old style are just like and extra rudder the new servo pendulum use you existing rudder to steer and the oar to provede the power
2017-12-20 16:28:07	ingmar_	C3D2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaqW0EYF20I
2017-12-20 16:28:14	ingmar_	C3D2: he explains it pretty well
2017-12-20 16:28:50	@Bill-Rangatira	if you have ever put your hand out the window of the car and angled to go up and down it is much the same
2017-12-20 16:29:27	ingmar_	but the basic principle is simple. wind vane moves a small rudder in the water. the water flowing past the rudder then moves it left or right, amplifying the force of the wind enough to move the tiller or quadrant (which steer the boat)
2017-12-20 16:30:09	C3D2	Cheers all, Marcus explained it along with seeing some footage of one in action made it sort of just.. click
2017-12-20 16:30:40	@Bill-Rangatira	Dave Parker has a really thorough look at them and even shows how to DIY them
2017-12-20 16:30:45	C3D2	I think, accurately summarised, it boils down to black magic fuckery
2017-12-20 16:30:55	ingmar_	C3D2: the real moment of astonishment happens when you look at what the bloody things cost.
2017-12-20 16:31:21	C3D2	Well, by default it's "marine" so tack a couple of zeros onto the end
2017-12-20 16:31:26	@Bill-Rangatira	http://blizzardguy.com/boat/projects/selfsteer/Index.html
2017-12-20 16:31:41	_alex_w__	they just aren't made in large enough quantities to mass produce them
2017-12-20 16:32:01	_alex_w__	as far as manufacturing goes they are pretty close to all being one offs
2017-12-20 16:32:14	_alex_w__	and i don't see that changing since most people use autopilots
2017-12-20 16:32:15	C3D2	+ and aren't they mostly made unique to the boat
2017-12-20 16:32:17	@Bill-Rangatira	not many sailors use them ... better for long offshore passages
2017-12-20 16:32:32	_alex_w__	no, just a small part of the mount is unique to the boat
2017-12-20 16:32:42	_alex_w__	Bill-Rangatira: long offshore passages on slow boats
2017-12-20 16:32:59	_alex_w__	they aren't responsive enough for surfing or planing boats
2017-12-20 16:33:07	C3D2	Don't they work on fast ones? or is it just economical
2017-12-20 16:33:07	@Bill-Rangatira	yes
2017-12-20 16:33:10	C3D2	beat me to it
2017-12-20 16:34:24	C3D2	Right, I'm riding home - be back shortly
2017-12-20 16:34:35		[C3D2 away: Bikin']
2017-12-20 16:34:43	@marcus	I guess modern autopilots also see apparent wind and take that into account on those fast boats?
2017-12-20 16:35:26	_alex_w__	yes.  my pilot is taking into account heading, rudder angle, pitch and roll, apparent wind direction and speed, and boat speed when figuring out how to steer
2017-12-20 16:35:32	_alex_w__	and that's a base model autopilot
2017-12-20 16:38:59	@marcus	sounds really nice
2017-12-20 16:38:59		[16:38]
2017-12-20 16:39:02	@marcus	which one do you have?
2017-12-20 16:39:29	_alex_w__	raymarine ev-100
2017-12-20 16:39:52	_alex_w__	http://www.raymarine.com/view/?id=7679
2017-12-20 16:40:07	_alex_w__	http://www.raymarine.com/view/?id=7008
2017-12-20 16:40:09	_alex_w__	second page is better
2017-12-20 16:40:33	@marcus	how much juice does taht system draw?
2017-12-20 16:41:25	ingmar_	a little bit for the electronics and a whole bunch for the drive unit :)
2017-12-20 16:41:47	ingmar_	so it depends on sea state and what responsiveness setting you have it on
2017-12-20 16:41:58	@Bill-Rangatira	the power draw is less if you have the sails well balanced
2017-12-20 16:41:58	@marcus	ah
2017-12-20 16:42:38	@marcus	average?
2017-12-20 16:42:42	@marcus	I'm just trying to get an idea
2017-12-20 16:42:53	_alex_w__	not much
2017-12-20 16:43:01	_alex_w__	like 10 watts
2017-12-20 16:43:22	@marcus	oh that's not bad
2017-12-20 16:43:23	ingmar_	depends mostly on your boat. it's the same force as when hand steering. if you have a balanced spade rudder, not that much unless you're being knocked about by waves. if you have a big unbalanced barn door, it'll have to work harder.
2017-12-20 16:43:32	_alex_w__	yeah, what ingmar_ says
2017-12-20 16:44:07	_alex_w__	but being balanced doesn't matter that much, it'll just hold the tiller off center.  holding doesn't take electricity, movement does
2017-12-20 16:44:18	_alex_w__	and if you are way out of balance the movements take more energy
2017-12-20 16:44:28	_alex_w__	we mostly use it motoring, but it does work well when sailing too
2017-12-20 16:44:34	ingmar_	sail balance doesn't matter much. i'm talking about balanced rudders (rudders that protrude forward of their pivot point)
2017-12-20 16:44:49	_alex_w__	ingmar_: i know, but bill said you need to have the sails balanced
2017-12-20 16:45:15	_alex_w__	i have a balanced rudder.  my boat is intentionally setup with a fair amount of weatherhelm when close hauled, so it isn't balanced then
2017-12-20 16:45:16	ingmar_	well, if you have a lot of weather helm, it does have to push against that in one direction
2017-12-20 16:45:50	_alex_w__	yes, but that doesn't take electricity.  when the motor is off the ram is locked
2017-12-20 16:45:58	ingmar_	i.e. the tiller is harder to push one way than the other
2017-12-20 16:46:06	ingmar_	it draws more during making a movement in that direction though
2017-12-20 16:46:23	_alex_w__	yes, that is true.  but that isn't that noticeable unless the seastate is really rough
2017-12-20 16:46:32	_alex_w__	noticeable in power draw, it is noticeable in tiller feel
2017-12-20 16:46:53	ingmar_	yeah, mostly the motors are fast running ones with a large gear ratio, so it's not a big difference
2017-12-20 16:46:54	_alex_w__	if it is pretty smooth, but windy, then the tiller doesn't need to be moved a lot
2017-12-20 16:47:03	ingmar_	aye
2017-12-20 16:47:19	_alex_w__	and that is often what happens here when we have good wind
2017-12-20 16:47:50	ingmar_	ours has 3 levels of responsiveness. we've only needed the 3rd one in 3-4m waves a few times, where level 2 didn't cope anymore.
2017-12-20 16:48:11	_alex_w__	ours has 9, it defaults to 5 and then i normally turn it down to 3
2017-12-20 16:48:30	_alex_w__	and i haven't used it downwind in surfing conditions, which is what is raelly supposed to stress autopilots
2017-12-20 16:48:46	_alex_w__	in the two or three times that we've had fun downwind surfing conditions we've driven by hand
2017-12-20 16:49:20	ingmar_	yup, ours was downwind. boat didn't surf too much though, which is good.
2017-12-20 16:50:46	ingmar_	back after our first channel crossing and after reading the heavy weather sailing book, i moved a lot of weight from the ends (forward and aft cabin) to the center (engine room) and that made the boat behave so much better in large-ish waves.
2017-12-20 16:52:11	_alex_w__	ah cool
2017-12-20 16:52:25	_alex_w__	we keep our ends empty, but i haven't experienced the difference first hadn

2017-12-20 17:23:27	Mr_Bubs	still warm enough to drink
2017-12-20 17:25:40	ingmar_	i think if your coffee sits in the cup for more than 1 hour, it's no longer drinking what you do. perhaps meditating?
2017-12-20 17:26:45	Mr_Bubs	this is a HUGH cup
2017-12-20 17:27:17	Mr_Bubs	30oz

2017-12-20 17:43:32	Mr_Bubs	I piss a lot
2017-12-20 17:43:37	Mr_Bubs	then beer when I get home

2017-12-20 19:10:49	ingmar_	splendid. just baked cookies :)

2017-12-20 19:10:59	ingmar_	you? haven't seen you in a while.
2017-12-20 19:11:21	clip68	I'm doing pretty well. It has been busy at work so I've not been online much.
2017-12-20 19:11:33	clip68	I'll be doing better in a week though
2017-12-20 19:11:42	clip68	I'm scheduled for a splash
2017-12-20 19:12:00	CalebD_	still liking Charleston though?
2017-12-20 19:12:03	clip68	(hopefully not too big of a splash)
2017-12-20 19:12:22	clip68	I very much like Charleston.
2017-12-20 19:12:38	clip68	There is a ton to do here. Being by the ocean is wonderful.
2017-12-20 19:13:15	_alex_w__	hi, and congrats on the move
2017-12-20 19:14:18	clip68	heya alex, and thank you
2017-12-20 19:14:46	clip68	I've just got to get used to dealing with the tides and currents
2017-12-20 19:14:58	_alex_w__	i didn't think sc coast had much of a tidal swing?
2017-12-20 19:15:39	_alex_w__	oh, you do get currents though
2017-12-20 19:15:56	_alex_w__	almost a 3 knot push down the river right now
2017-12-20 19:16:05	clip68	the tides are as big an issue as the currents
2017-12-20 19:16:13	clip68	yeah, exactly
2017-12-20 19:16:13	_alex_w__	deepzoom.com can become your favorite website
2017-12-20 19:16:35	clip68	oh cool!
2017-12-20 19:16:36	_alex_w__	about a 6' tidal range right now
2017-12-20 19:17:07	_alex_w__	they do a good job of tidal/current visualizations
2017-12-20 19:17:11	_alex_w__	i always use it when planning
2017-12-20 19:18:11	clip68	if only it didn't think I was in Washington state
2017-12-20 19:18:24	_alex_w__	the author lives here
2017-12-20 19:18:41	_alex_w__	they don't see to use location services to pick a reasonable default, nor do they encode the location into the url :(
2017-12-20 19:19:04	_alex_w__	i still don't know anything better

2017-12-20 19:21:50	_alex_w__	l-36.com is helpful too, but deepzoom visualizes complex current patterns in a more useful way
2017-12-20 19:22:24	CalebD_	lemme take a look
2017-12-20 19:22:39	clip68	1.4 knots at my dock
2017-12-20 19:23:02	clip68	that shouldn't be horrible but that is probably because the tide is coming in
2017-12-20 19:23:37	_alex_w__	if you click on a square yellow block that is a tide station
2017-12-20 19:23:47	_alex_w__	and it will show you the daily tide graph in the upper right
2017-12-20 19:23:55	_alex_w__	there is also a slider at the bottom to adjust time of day
2017-12-20 19:23:55		[19:23]
2017-12-20 19:24:24	_alex_w__	and if you click on an arrow the graph will show that tide station instead

2017-12-20 19:29:32	_alex_w__	ingmar_: that boat that lost it's keel is still for sale too
2017-12-20 19:29:51	ingmar_	_alex_w__: i wouldn't buy a boat without a keel, having just read how much work it is to make a new one ;)
2017-12-20 19:30:00	_alex_w__	i started a sailing anarchy thread and looked around for more info.  i also found an italian article where the manufacturer is flying there to investigate
2017-12-20 19:30:10	_alex_w__	the boat was towed into shore
2017-12-20 19:30:11	ingmar_	_alex_w__: http://edwinmuth.com/Hobbies-Sailing-Refit.php
2017-12-20 19:30:59	ingmar_	well, it is a comet. those do tend to lose bits underway. thus the tail...
2017-12-20 19:31:00	clip68	a boat without a keel....
2017-12-20 19:31:22	clip68	maybe they will paint the hull with glittery paint and put a pair of jet drives under it
2017-12-20 19:31:56	_alex_w__	it was just for sale before losing it's keel, and they haven't pulled the ad
2017-12-20 19:32:10	_alex_w__	ingmar_: ah, the builder claimed that they had never lost a keel
2017-12-20 19:32:16	_alex_w__	i haven't heard of them before
2017-12-20 19:32:35	_alex_w__	probably not nice enough to bother importing to the US
2017-12-20 19:32:59	_alex_w__	where x-yachts or malo or other euro brands are often imported
2017-12-20 19:33:53	_alex_w__	i just moved my desk into a new room that is half full of our HR team, so I don't think I'll be looking at sailing anarchy much from work anymore
2017-12-20 19:34:07	clip68	yeah, but a lot of those imported boats electrical systems are exactly compatible with the stuff over here
2017-12-20 19:36:25	clip68	Met a couple here in Charleston living on their Oyster
2017-12-20 19:37:05	clip68	they have a hard time with the differences in electricity
2017-12-20 19:37:11	 *	clip68 knows very little about it
2017-12-20 19:37:49	_alex_w__	hmm, i think all that would need to be changed on my boat is the actual outlets
2017-12-20 19:37:57	_alex_w__	everything is compatible with 120 or 240
2017-12-20 19:38:11	_alex_w__	not like the AC system is complex on most boats
2017-12-20 19:39:05	clip68	they were talking about appliances and stuff
2017-12-20 19:39:05		[19:39]
2017-12-20 19:39:19	clip68	so, definitely DC

2017-12-20 20:13:38	clip68	planning on going for a walk on the beach
2017-12-20 20:13:41	Mr_Bubs	that was actually fun
2017-12-20 20:14:09	clip68	It might be fun, if the shack had a heater, and cable tv
2017-12-20 20:14:18	clip68	oh... and a fully stocked bar
2017-12-20 20:14:22	Mr_Bubs	it was heated

2017-12-20 20:15:12	clip68	Speaking of cable... where the hell would I go to buy coax, ends and a crimper these days?
2017-12-20 20:15:40	_alex_w__	for vhf on the boat?  or for your cable tv at home?
2017-12-20 20:15:59	clip68	our marina has cable at the docks
2017-12-20 20:16:16	clip68	need a long run to go from the power pedestal to the boat
2017-12-20 20:16:24	_alex_w__	last time i bought that stuff was a frys about 10 years ago
2017-12-20 20:16:46	_alex_w__	the good quality crimpers aren't that cheap, if you just want one cable it probably better to buy just that
2017-12-20 20:16:48	Mr_Bubs	75Ω
2017-12-20 20:17:14	Mr_Bubs	Chris, Lowe's carries connectors that don't require a crimper
2017-12-20 20:17:23	Mr_Bubs	lemme find a link for you
2017-12-20 20:17:25	clip68	oh cool!
2017-12-20 20:17:34	clip68	that would make it much easier
2017-12-20 20:17:38	Mr_Bubs	how long of cable do you need?
2017-12-20 20:18:06	_alex_w__	hmm, i'd worry about the quality of those.  cable tv is pretty sensitive to good quality cables
2017-12-20 20:18:18	_alex_w__	at least these days with 500 channels of hd crap
2017-12-20 20:18:45	Mr_Bubs	they're working fine for me
2017-12-20 20:18:57	Mr_Bubs	although I'm using an antenna, not cable
2017-12-20 20:19:01	clip68	lets see... the tv is a good ways forward call it 20 feet + another 6 or so to the box with some left over
2017-12-20 20:19:07	clip68	so, maybe 25-26'
2017-12-20 20:19:23	_alex_w__	yes, antenna is using much less of the bandwidth
2017-12-20 20:19:25	Mr_Bubs	you can buy a cable with the ends already on there
2017-12-20 20:19:31	_alex_w__	yeah, that is what i'd do for a single cable
2017-12-20 20:19:37	Mr_Bubs	I bought a 50' cable the other day at Lowes
2017-12-20 20:19:39	_alex_w__	i bought the new crimper and ends when i redid the entire house
2017-12-20 20:19:47	clip68	Lowes or Home depot then?
2017-12-20 20:19:54	Mr_Bubs	yeah
2017-12-20 20:19:56	_alex_w__	or amazon
2017-12-20 20:20:14	Mr_Bubs	they'll probably have a 30' cable
2017-12-20 20:22:37	clip68	wonder if I should by a shorter female to mail cable that ends at the hatch and then another female to female to go from there to the dock
2017-12-20 20:22:50	clip68	that way I can mount the one in the cabin properly
2017-12-20 20:23:17	_alex_w__	marinoco makes a nice waterproof bulkhead connector for this
2017-12-20 20:23:25	_alex_w__	my old boat had it (oddly it came wired for cable from the factory)
2017-12-20 20:24:14	clip68	interesting

2017-12-20 20:26:31	_alex_w__	tv-only variation saves you $20
2017-12-20 20:28:39	clip68	you aren't kidding
2017-12-20 20:28:44	clip68	not cheep at all
2017-12-20 20:28:59	_alex_w__	the $30 one isn't that bad
2017-12-20 20:29:24	_alex_w__	are you living aboard?
2017-12-20 20:30:17	clip68	No. We'll be there most weekends and scattered weeks through the year.
2017-12-20 20:30:50	clip68	that is why I was just thinking the low rent version instead of drilling holes in the boat
2017-12-20 20:30:51	clip68	lol
2017-12-20 20:33:16	clip68	for $65 I can get a marine rated 25' coax cable! What a deal!
2017-12-20 20:33:17	_alex_w__	i wouldn't drill holes, i'd just sneak it through the hatch
2017-12-20 20:33:34	_alex_w__	i would look for something designed to be flexible
2017-12-20 20:33:39	clip68	that is what I'm thinking alex
2017-12-20 20:33:41	_alex_w__	check rv sources
2017-12-20 20:33:53	_alex_w__	regular coax has a solid core wire that is going to fatigue
2017-12-20 20:34:00	clip68	that is a great point
2017-12-20 20:34:19	clip68	there is a camping world about 2 miles from my house
2017-12-20 20:34:31	clip68	you can find many many items there
2017-12-20 20:36:35	_alex_w__	i expect the flexible stuff is going to cost more because it'll have a stranded copper core.  but it shouldn't be 5x the price
2017-12-20 20:36:50	_alex_w__	the cheap wire is just coated steel core
2017-12-20 20:37:33	Mr_Bubs	I use stranded core coax or stranded core ladder line for all my antennas.
2017-12-20 20:37:56	clip68	of course if it fails every 2 years at 1/6th the prices I can afford to replace the cheap stuff when it breaks
2017-12-20 20:38:07	_alex_w__	it sucks to make all of that trash
2017-12-20 20:38:17	_alex_w__	it's not something that can easily be recycled
2017-12-20 20:38:34	clip68	true
2017-12-20 20:38:54	clip68	of course, if the wifi is any good (yet to be determined) I may just stick with Roku
2017-12-20 20:39:15	_alex_w__	we just stream tv over our cell connection
2017-12-20 20:39:21	_alex_w__	it's better than wifi
2017-12-20 20:39:35	Mr_Bubs	I don't know that I've ever seen 75Ω with a stranded core, though
2017-12-20 20:40:15	Mr_Bubs	we have a TV antenna.  But usually we just watch DVD's
2017-12-20 20:40:22	Mr_Bubs	marina has WiFi, too
2017-12-20 20:40:51	clip68	you can get it in bulk Bubs
2017-12-20 20:40:57	clip68	don't know about fully made up
2017-12-20 20:41:47	Mr_Bubs	I've only used 75Ω for house stuff
2017-12-20 20:41:47		[20:41]
2017-12-20 20:42:15	Mr_Bubs	all my radio stuff required 50Ω
2017-12-20 20:42:19	Mr_Bubs	requires
2017-12-20 20:42:23	Mr_Bubs	or ladder line
2017-12-20 20:44:26	_alex_w__	belden 1694f seems to be the magic search
2017-12-20 20:44:36	_alex_w__	$35 gets you a finished 25' cable
2017-12-20 20:44:52	_alex_w__	which is 3x what one with a crappy steel core costs, seems worth it
2017-12-20 20:46:46	clip68	I ran across the brand a moment ago when I was looking at bulk cable
2017-12-20 20:46:57	_alex_w__	tecnec
2017-12-20 20:48:36	Mr_Bubs	I'm just backing up all of our DVD's onto a mini HDD and using that thing I posted yesterday
2017-12-20 20:49:00	Mr_Bubs	tiny foot print, very little power consumption
2017-12-20 20:50:55	clip68	of course if I used duct tape to tape the less expensive cable to the shore power cable, it will reduce the flexing
2017-12-20 20:51:21	clip68	use a snubber on both of them...
2017-12-20 20:52:16	Mr_Bubs	there's a trick I do for my ham antennas
2017-12-20 20:52:38	clip68	please tell me it doesn't involve lube and a gerbil
2017-12-20 20:52:44	Mr_Bubs	I attach the wire antenna to paracord that's under tension
2017-12-20 20:53:01	Mr_Bubs	so the wire never gets stressed
2017-12-20 20:53:01	_alex_w__	well, boats move
2017-12-20 20:53:18	_alex_w__	so there isn't a piece of paracord that can be under tension
2017-12-20 20:53:34	Mr_Bubs	just when I build it, Alex
2017-12-20 20:53:43	Mr_Bubs	I put the antenna up with slack in it
2017-12-20 20:54:07	_alex_w__	if you wanted to save a couple of dollars you could run cheap cable to near the cockpit, then have a 6' leader of the flexible stuff going frmo the dock to the boat.  but splices suck too.
2017-12-20 20:54:17	_alex_w__	i'd just stream over cell signal or wifi for a while
2017-12-20 20:54:19	clip68	ahh, you attach it tensioned so it stays with the paracord when it slack
2017-12-20 20:54:25	Mr_Bubs	I hate spicing if I don't  have to
2017-12-20 20:54:32	Mr_Bubs	especially coax
2017-12-20 20:55:02	_alex_w__	but the stranded copper core coax is only a tiny bit more than solid copper core.  it's only crappy steel core that is cheap
2017-12-20 20:55:39	clip68	but if you duct tape it to the stronger shore power cable...
2017-12-20 20:55:45	Mr_Bubs	LOL
2017-12-20 20:55:51	_alex_w__	that isn't going to reduce flex as teh boat moves around
2017-12-20 20:56:04	_alex_w__	or when you disconnect the shore power
2017-12-20 20:56:25	clip68	awwww, crap... it is raining
2017-12-20 20:56:41	 *	clip68 did NOT bring any rain gear
2017-12-20 20:57:21	CalebD_	time for a shower
2017-12-20 20:57:21		[20:57]
2017-12-20 20:58:13	clip68	I was about to say something Caleb...
2017-12-20 20:58:16	 *	clip68 grins
2017-12-20 20:58:58	CalebD_	so did you guys do some beaching in SC this summer ?
2017-12-20 20:59:00	_alex_w__	a bridge is opening to bikes at 3pm that cuts my bike to home distance in half
2017-12-20 20:59:11	_alex_w__	and it's a beautiful (though cold) sunny day
2017-12-20 20:59:18	_alex_w__	so i'm looking forward to 3pm.
2017-12-20 20:59:24	clip68	very cool
2017-12-20 20:59:50	clip68	I will have to admit Charleston isn't exactly a bike friendly city
2017-12-20 21:00:09	_alex_w__	yeah, i spent a summer in asheville, nc (21.5 years ago) and riding there was scary
2017-12-20 21:00:39	_alex_w__	roads are narrow, people drive fast, and no one even knows what a bike is let alone why one would be on their road
2017-12-20 21:01:27	clip68	it isn't quite that bad
2017-12-20 21:01:41	clip68	but I'd not try to commute on one
2017-12-20 21:01:45	_alex_w__	asheville probably isn't that bad anymore either
2017-12-20 21:01:54	clip68	true
2017-12-20 21:02:21	_alex_w__	the 12 mile commute home will only have me on shared roads for about 1 mile
2017-12-20 21:02:34	_alex_w__	the old 25 mile way was the same
2017-12-20 21:03:03	Mr_Bubs	I don't like riding a bicycle here
2017-12-20 21:04:02	Mr_Bubs	the new Hanson Christmas album is pretty good, FYI
2017-12-20 21:04:28	Mr_Bubs	https://www.amazon.com/Finally-Its-Christmas-Hanson/dp/B075HH5ZTR
2017-12-20 21:04:54	@marcus	man I didn't like riding a bike in MO either
2017-12-20 21:04:59	@marcus	I rode the katy trail or mountain biked
2017-12-20 21:05:08	@marcus	I only started riding on the road once I moved here
2017-12-20 21:05:19	clip68	I'll pass Bubs
2017-12-20 21:09:24	clip68	These billboards cropped up around Charleston featuring a grandma holding an AR-15 pointing it at a reindeer
2017-12-20 21:09:31	clip68	with the caption "not this year!"
2017-12-20 21:09:42	@marcus	grandma got run over by a reindoor
2017-12-20 21:09:44	@marcus	eer
2017-12-20 21:09:50	clip68	I finally had to explain them to the wife. Along with a truly dreadful repeat of the song
2017-12-20 21:09:50	Mr_Bubs	LOL
2017-12-20 21:10:06	clip68	Exactly marcus
2017-12-20 21:10:17	Mr_Bubs	I normally don't like much Christmas music.  But this album is pretty good
2017-12-20 21:11:49	clip68	now this is Christmas music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5veA5DWJck
2017-12-20 21:12:07	Mr_Bubs	LOL.
2017-12-20 21:12:18	Mr_Bubs	I have the Twisted Sister Christmas album, too
2017-12-20 21:12:42	_alex_w__	they don't still exist, do they?
2017-12-20 21:12:42		[21:12]
2017-12-20 21:12:50	clip68	"Rip off the head of another bat, pass it this way and lets cheer for Jeebus!"
2017-12-20 21:12:54	_alex_w__	also, isn't hanson a boy band from 20 years ago?  does that translate as they grow up?
2017-12-20 21:12:55	Mr_Bubs	if they do, they're not a thing anymore
2017-12-20 21:13:04	Mr_Bubs	yes it does Alex
2017-12-20 21:13:26	clip68	They just morph into a "dad bod" band
2017-12-20 21:13:31	Mr_Bubs	they're pretty good.  Mrs. Bubs has all their albums
2017-12-20 21:13:43	@marcus	...
2017-12-20 21:13:54	Mr_Bubs	there's a noticeable progression
2017-12-20 21:14:47	clip68	I think it is called puberty
2017-12-20 21:14:51	Mr_Bubs	LOL

2017-12-20 21:21:33	clip68	Oh lord. I haven't seen that in years.
2017-12-20 21:21:35	CalebD_	ok, so we've been down this rabbit hole before then
2017-12-20 21:21:46	clip68	Probably a decade or more
2017-12-20 21:22:54	clip68	I did watch North by Northwest the other day, although I think that is Cary Grant
2017-12-20 21:23:22	CalebD_	yes - that is an oldy but goody
2017-12-20 21:23:24	_alex_w__	i just cleaned out my trackball and now it runs at racecar speed
2017-12-20 21:23:39	_alex_w__	which makes me think about how much gunk i'm pushing around the other 364 days of the year
2017-12-20 21:24:01	clip68	clean out the keyboard next and then really be grossed out
2017-12-20 21:24:20	@marcus	I just keep the lights real low so I can't see it
2017-12-20 21:24:24	clip68	LOL
2017-12-20 21:24:27	_alex_w__	i did the keyboard a couple of days ago
2017-12-20 21:24:44	_alex_w__	i've been using this keyboard for 15 years now, i'm amazed that it still has letters on the keys
2017-12-20 21:24:57	_alex_w__	i have one in storage for when this one fails, hopefully these two handle the rest of my career
2017-12-20 21:24:58	@marcus	is it a white microsoft natural?
2017-12-20 21:25:14	_alex_w__	no, it is an older goldtouch usb
2017-12-20 21:25:17	clip68	Mine is a black one marcus
2017-12-20 21:25:25	@marcus	the original version of those was so tough, we used to just put them in the shower to lcean them out
2017-12-20 21:25:28	@marcus	later versions, not so much
2017-12-20 21:26:27	Mr_Bubs	I still have my old IBM keyboard from like '87
2017-12-20 21:26:38	clip68	I love mechanicals

2017-12-20 21:26:48	Mr_Bubs	but nothing uses a PS2 port anymore
2017-12-20 21:26:51	clip68	if only I couldn't find one in the same style as a natural
2017-12-20 21:26:52	_alex_w__	that's it
2017-12-20 21:26:53	@marcus	I have a couple of mechanicals now that I like
2017-12-20 21:27:02	@marcus	but for lots of typing I prefer the microsoft natural
2017-12-20 21:27:06	_alex_w__	they stopped putting the pgup/pgdn keys on the left like that
2017-12-20 21:27:08	@marcus	I can't type a lot on a square keyboard
2017-12-20 21:27:28	clip68	I know the feeling marcus
2017-12-20 21:27:31	_alex_w__	this is even better than a ms natural because it ditches the wasteful number keypad, so my trackball is closer to centerline
2017-12-20 21:27:38	_alex_w__	and i love having pgup/pgdn on the left like that
2017-12-20 21:27:43	_alex_w__	and home/end
2017-12-20 21:27:43		[21:27]
2017-12-20 21:27:52	@marcus	I wish someone would make the natural layout with mech keys for a reasonable price
2017-12-20 21:27:56	_alex_w__	and you can adjust the angle and width of the tenting
2017-12-20 21:28:06	_alex_w__	these are mechanical keys marcus
2017-12-20 21:28:34	clip68	it would take a long time to get used to that layout
2017-12-20 21:28:42	Mr_Bubs	https://www.ebay.com/i/142551100177?chn=ps
2017-12-20 21:28:45	Mr_Bubs	holy shit
2017-12-20 21:29:04	Mr_Bubs	that price has to be wrong
2017-12-20 21:29:17	_alex_w__	clip68: they switched the layout because other people didn't like it either
2017-12-20 21:29:28	_alex_w__	but it is really nice for mousing if you are a right hander
2017-12-20 21:29:36	_alex_w__	mouse in right hand, pgup/pgdn/home/end in left
2017-12-20 21:29:38	Mr_Bubs	are they really going for that these days?
2017-12-20 21:30:19	clip68	mechanicals are all the rage these days
2017-12-20 21:30:56	Mr_Bubs	I have like 4 of them
2017-12-20 21:31:16	Mr_Bubs	when you couldn't get them anymore I bought every one I came across
2017-12-20 21:32:34	clip68	well, you should put 'em up on ebay then
2017-12-20 21:32:49	Mr_Bubs	apparently
2017-12-20 21:34:13	clip68	you could buy your beer for the next sailing trip!
2017-12-20 21:34:48	_alex_w__	i never liked the keyswitches in the ibm keyboards, they are too stiff
2017-12-20 21:36:16	Mr_Bubs	I like the tactile feedback
2017-12-20 21:36:25	clip68	I used nothing but them for the first decade of my career
2017-12-20 21:36:27	Mr_Bubs	and the clickity clack sound
2017-12-20 21:36:52	clip68	besides I learned to type on a manual keyboard... THOSE are some stiff keys
