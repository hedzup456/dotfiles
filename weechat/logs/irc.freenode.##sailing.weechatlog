2017-12-07 20:33:50	@_alex_w_	the old recommendation was 64x, i think it changed to 72x so that 64x is still untapered

2017-12-07 20:38:39	C3D2	lucky git, I can't
2017-12-07 20:38:54	@_alex_w_	if you find old samson instructions (i can't quickly find them online) they do 3 fid bury lengths, a fid is 21 diameters, so it was 63x

2017-12-07 20:39:04	@_alex_w_	now they say 3.5 which is 73.5x

2017-12-07 20:40:18	Essington	I can remember diameters
2017-12-07 20:40:42	@_alex_w_	and i do a mix of brummel vs simple bury (to takl about theo ther parts of that blog page)
2017-12-07 20:40:51	@_alex_w_	sometimes bury is easier/faster when dealing with hardware
2017-12-07 20:41:19	Essington	I always brummel
2017-12-07 20:41:29	Essington	simply for the security of it all
2017-12-07 20:41:44	@_alex_w_	well, sometimes that isn't possible when you have fixed hardware on both sides
2017-12-07 20:42:05	@_alex_w_	like my traveler line (which is control-dpx, same single braid splices) is a simple bury
2017-12-07 20:42:27	@_alex_w_	if i wanted to brummel i'd have to put a soft or hard shackle in there
2017-12-07 20:42:47	Essington	yeah, I guess that is a case ...
2017-12-07 20:43:09	@_alex_w_	same thing with the backstay on my old boat, which had a thimble in one end and a huge low friction ring at the other
2017-12-07 20:43:19	Essington	even my bronze eyes were able to be brummeled on both ends ...
2017-12-07 20:43:44	@_alex_w_	did you make them a hair oversized and slip the eye in after the splice was finished?

2017-12-07 20:44:55	@_alex_w_	yes, that thimble is too large to be passed through the braid, so at one point did you install it into the splice?
2017-12-07 20:45:01	Essington	nah, stuff a couple of pieces of PVC into the loop and twist them ... it inverts the brummel just enough to slip over the thimble, then you relax and bury

2017-12-08 19:08:50	singlerider	I feel like steering is kind of a brainless activity
2017-12-08 19:08:59	singlerider	It's time to outsource!
2017-12-08 19:09:04	@Marcus	:D
2017-12-08 19:09:26	@Marcus	the mount is huge for my boat
2017-12-08 19:09:32	@Marcus	obscures the entire stern
2017-12-08 19:09:39	singlerider	Dude, for mine, it's will be MASSIVE
2017-12-08 19:09:47	singlerider	Marcus: I have a transom hung rudder
2017-12-08 19:09:52	@Marcus	yeah same here
2017-12-08 19:10:02	singlerider	Ah, yeah. you know the struggle

2017-12-08 19:11:17	singlerider	Hehe
2017-12-08 19:11:30	singlerider	Dan-NS27's boat is 9 feet shorted than mine and has all the same stuff
2017-12-08 19:11:34	singlerider	shorter*
2017-12-08 19:12:40	@Marcus	the mount for the windpilot is a lot smaller

2017-12-08 19:12:58	@Marcus	but it looks like a delicate failure point where that the vane connects to the base
2017-12-08 19:13:02	singlerider	Marcus: would you like a picture of the mounting setup drawing for my boat?

2017-12-08 19:16:08	singlerider	Berkeley might be pissed about the length :p
2017-12-08 19:16:53	@Marcus	that system looks a lot more robust
2017-12-08 19:17:08	singlerider	I'm super pumped about finally getting a windvane
2017-12-08 19:17:18	singlerider	I negotiated it in the purchase price
2017-12-08 19:17:22	@Marcus	it's on my must have list
2017-12-08 19:17:28	@Marcus	I don't want to hand steer to teh bahamas
2017-12-08 19:17:39	singlerider	"it" being the windvane, minus the mounting system
2017-12-08 19:18:59	@Marcus	it's a big expense but I imagine you can bring it to your next boat if you want
2017-12-08 19:19:04	@Marcus	and not include it in the sale
2017-12-08 19:19:59	CalebD_	the mounting hardware varies from boat to boat often
2017-12-08 19:20:30	@Marcus	right
2017-12-08 19:20:41	@Marcus	but on my boat, at the high end all fixed up say it's worth... 18
2017-12-08 19:20:43	CalebD_	but the basic guts are the same
2017-12-08 19:21:01	@Marcus	if I have 28 in it because of life raft and self steer, I woujldn't sell the boat for 18 with those items included
2017-12-08 19:21:18	@Marcus	since they can be transferred to another boat, I'd jsut take them off and sell without
2017-12-08 19:22:31	@Marcus	does that make sense?
2017-12-08 19:22:41	@Marcus	I mean, when this boat is done, it's going to have more in it than I can reasonably sell it for
2017-12-08 19:22:55	@Marcus	but if I can remove a couple of high ticket items, then sell it for what it's worth, then I'm okay with that
2017-12-08 19:23:10	@Marcus	i don't plan on selling it, but you never know
2017-12-08 19:23:19	singlerider	Why ever sell?
2017-12-08 19:23:19	CalebD_	yeah, life raft and wind vane could be sold separately
2017-12-08 19:23:24	singlerider	Get something bigger?
2017-12-08 19:23:25	@Marcus	singlerider: bigger boat
2017-12-08 19:23:38	singlerider	Driving my 36 feels overwhelming
2017-12-08 19:23:39	CalebD_	or kept for next boat
2017-12-08 19:23:39	@Marcus	if fortune puts me in a place where I could have an alberg 35 or 37, then I probably would do it
2017-12-08 19:24:01	singlerider	I've piloted a 55 footer and I felt like I was driving an aircraft carrier
2017-12-08 19:24:37	singlerider	Marcus: that's some serious sail area
2017-12-08 19:24:49	singlerider	That boom is gigantic
2017-12-08 19:25:02	@Marcus	which boom?
2017-12-08 19:25:08	singlerider	Alberg 35
2017-12-08 19:25:19	@Marcus	yeah I suppose so
2017-12-08 19:25:32	@Marcus	the boom in my finn is like 11.5' long and the boat is only 14'
2017-12-08 19:25:35	@Marcus	to me it feels normal
2017-12-08 19:25:43	CalebD_	and the shape of the stern of an Alberg 35 is pretty similar to your Marieholm, just bigger
2017-12-08 19:25:45	singlerider	My boom is super short
2017-12-08 19:25:54	@Marcus	the boom in the marieholm is a lot shorter
2017-12-08 19:26:11	CalebD_	just not sure the size wind vane you buy for the Marieholm will be big enough for an Alberg 35
2017-12-08 19:26:23	singlerider	Size wind vane?
2017-12-08 19:26:33	singlerider	I don't think the size of the wind vane matters so much
2017-12-08 19:26:46	CalebD_	idk
2017-12-08 19:26:48	singlerider	As long as it can turn a wheel
2017-12-08 19:27:07	singlerider	(in my case, a wheel)
2017-12-08 19:27:14	@Marcus	doesn't monitor only make one size?
2017-12-08 19:27:21	singlerider	I think so
2017-12-08 19:27:32	singlerider	Well, Monitor is the product, Scanmar is the company
2017-12-08 19:28:25	CalebD_	well if it is one size fits all then you are in luck
2017-12-08 19:28:25		[19:28]
2017-12-08 19:28:43	@Marcus	wind pilot makes several sizes but the size for my boat is also the size for an alberg
2017-12-08 19:28:44	CalebD_	unlike with tiller pilots which vary in torque
2017-12-08 19:28:46	@Marcus	so I'd be okay
2017-12-08 19:28:47	singlerider	CalebD_: the mounting hardware changes, as mentioned earlier
2017-12-08 19:29:12	CalebD_	idk windvanes that well
2017-12-08 19:29:59	singlerider	CalebD_: are you familiar with how they operate?
2017-12-08 19:30:07	singlerider	Because it's cool
2017-12-08 19:30:14	CalebD_	conceptually yes
2017-12-08 19:30:39	CalebD_	but no experience using a wind vane

2017-12-08 19:36:43	singlerider	A Monitor can also behave as an emergency rudder!
2017-12-08 19:36:57	@Marcus	don't you have to buy some part that costs like 2 grand for that?
2017-12-08 19:37:13	singlerider	There is another part. I dunno its cost
2017-12-08 19:37:18	singlerider	But the point still stands
2017-12-08 19:37:47	@Marcus	yes
2017-12-08 19:37:56	singlerider	Or I could use it as a Dual Rudder

2017-12-11 16:04:38	singlerider	Like I was in prison and my time was served

2017-12-11 16:13:02	singlerider	Are you both converting your boats into ice breakers?
2017-12-11 16:13:04	C3D2	singlerider: 2 degrees C (little over 35F)
2017-12-11 16:13:16	singlerider	C3D2: I was right. Sounds awful
2017-12-11 16:13:28	Kjango	I spent most of my adult life in Montana & Alaska so this is ok.
2017-12-11 16:13:34	C3D2	could be worse, I was camping Friday night
2017-12-11 16:13:50	C3D2	lows of -3C (26,6F)
2017-12-11 16:13:57	Kjango	Yepper....that would be worse.
2017-12-11 16:14:03	singlerider	Yes, it could be absolute zero
2017-12-11 16:14:13	singlerider	But you could also be in Baja
2017-12-11 16:14:19	singlerider	So it could be better
2017-12-11 16:14:21	C3D2	I may or may not have had a small fire directly under my hammock
2017-12-11 16:14:27	C3D2	It could aways be better

2017-12-11 16:14:50	singlerider	How could it be better than that?
2017-12-11 16:14:58	Kjango	Snowing here this morning......I just put out seeds for the birds.

2017-12-11 16:15:04	C3D2	Yeah, I love waterboarding in the bay!
2017-12-11 16:15:26	C3D2	Snowing very lightly on and off here. Still enough to grind the country to a half
2017-12-11 16:15:33	C3D2	s/half/halt
2017-12-11 16:17:43	Kjango	I was remembering this morning ghosting along at 2-3 knots on a winter day snowing so hard I could only see maybe 50 feet past the bow but it was so calm it was eerily pleasant.
2017-12-11 16:18:40	@Marcus	I've always wanted to sail in the snow
2017-12-11 16:18:52	Kjango	What kind of boats are you guys sailing ???
2017-12-11 16:19:05	@Marcus	I have a Finn, a Snipe, and a Marieholm 261 that I'm rebuilding
2017-12-11 16:19:24	C3D2	Only imaginary ones, currently
2017-12-11 16:19:30	Kjango	I've never done it on purpose Marcus ,  but have got caught a few times.
2017-12-11 16:19:32	C3D2	Woe is me and all that jazz
2017-12-11 16:19:46	Kjango	I feel ya C3.
2017-12-11 16:19:50	@Marcus	Kjango: sometimes it's so peaceful when it's snowing, I just think it would be nice... but cold as shit probably
2017-12-11 16:19:55	@Marcus	and I owuldn't do it in my dinghies
2017-12-11 16:21:16	Kjango	Thats how peaceful I was speaking of Marcus.
2017-12-11 16:21:32	@Marcus	I'm pickin up what you're layin down
2017-12-11 16:22:06	Kjango	The day I was speaking of was on a 40' wood flush deck cutter
2017-12-11 16:22:41	Kjango	I'm sailing a Columbia 9.6 meter these days.
2017-12-11 16:24:08	C3D2	I'm on a Oceanis 37 in May? Does that count?
2017-12-11 16:24:24	Kjango	That way counts C3
2017-12-11 16:24:40	C3D2	Hell yeah
2017-12-11 16:24:49	C3D2	Sadly, I won't own her
2017-12-11 16:25:06	C3D2	Or, for that matter, still be on her at the other end of May :'(
2017-12-11 16:26:05	Kjango	Still it's sailing.

2017-12-11 16:29:47	Kjango	It's helps a bit shopping for gear to take my boat in the Spring.
2017-12-11 16:30:59	C3D2	Kjango: I had a quick look at a map and was like "Oh that's not too bad", then realised that Michigan is roughly the same size as my entire country (and then some)
2017-12-11 16:32:04	Kjango	Yeah.....I'm pretty far away
2017-12-11 16:32:36	C3D2	The scale of the states continues to absolutely blow my mind
2017-12-11 16:33:18	Kjango	I just came back from a vacation on Anna Maria Island in Florida so I shouldn't feel too bad.
2017-12-11 16:33:45	@Marcus	C3D2: you should try driving across them, it's absurd.  You can drive for an entire day and not even be out of texas or california
2017-12-11 16:34:41	C3D2	I'll pass, thanks. The 170-odd miles I drove when looking at unis was bad enough for me, in one block
2017-12-11 16:35:06	C3D2	That said, I do still want to go on a great American road trip..
2017-12-11 16:36:03	Kjango	exactly Marcus.......I was driving once across the Shiprock desert.......Thought I be at Ship Rock in like 20 minutes.......drove like 3 hours & all that happened was the rock kept getting bigger
2017-12-11 16:36:21	@Marcus	yeah the scale of things is ... ridiculous

2017-12-12 15:58:12	singlerider	Today is the day I get my hands on my windvane mount
2017-12-12 15:59:08	@Marcus	is this a self install thing?
2017-12-12 15:59:21	singlerider	Marcus: yeah
2017-12-12 15:59:21	@Marcus	C3D2: where in southwest England?
2017-12-12 15:59:31	@Marcus	singlerider: let me know how it goes
2017-12-12 15:59:35	singlerider	Drilling the transom
2017-12-12 15:59:45	singlerider	I think I'll install it on Sunday
2017-12-12 15:59:49	@Marcus	are you going to put reinforcing plates inside?
2017-12-12 15:59:54	singlerider	I'll get Lnk and elektron to help
2017-12-12 16:00:01	singlerider	Marcus: probably
2017-12-12 16:00:18	singlerider	I won't be able to be there when the mount is picked up
2017-12-12 16:00:28	singlerider	I have a boat guy going on my behalf
2017-12-12 16:00:34	singlerider	He'll make sure I have everything
2017-12-12 16:03:28	_alex_w__	yeah, you'll need backing plates inside the transom
2017-12-12 16:03:49	_alex_w__	but those are easy to make and g10 isnt' that expensive

2017-12-12 16:13:24	@Bill-Rangatira	but g10 can be a pain to cut
2017-12-12 16:13:51	_alex_w__	it cuts like butter with a fine tooth hacksaw
2017-12-12 16:14:41	@Bill-Rangatira	ok i have had trouble cutting it with a hole saw
2017-12-12 16:14:57	@Marcus	cuts fine on my band saw, and with a hole saw too
2017-12-12 16:15:04	@Marcus	try using a sharper blade
2017-12-12 16:15:14	@Marcus	I have to sharpen my hole saws once in a while, fiberglass dulls them pretty quick
2017-12-12 16:15:14	_alex_w__	yeah, i also have no problems with a hole saw, but you need to clear chips often
2017-12-12 16:15:31	_alex_w__	and i also use a bandsaw most of the time, but figured most people didn't have easy access to one at the dock
2017-12-12 16:15:32	@Bill-Rangatira	i found it got hot quickly and gummed up the teeth
2017-12-12 16:15:43	_alex_w__	then your holesaw is dull and chips aren't clearing
2017-12-12 16:15:59	_alex_w__	and once hot it won't work, you need to keep it cool
2017-12-12 16:16:04	_alex_w__	your cutting speed might be too high
2017-12-12 16:16:12	_alex_w__	the heat causes the epoxy to melt instead of cut
2017-12-12 16:16:24	@Bill-Rangatira	i used a water bath and it cut much better
2017-12-12 16:16:39	_alex_w__	i use a hole saw on a milling machine (drill press would be fine too) at like 150rpm
2017-12-12 16:17:39	@Bill-Rangatira	but i was also using a 6" holesaw for backing plates
2017-12-12 16:18:34	_alex_w__	then you need to go ever slower
2017-12-12 16:18:55	_alex_w__	to keep sfm down
2017-12-12 16:20:20	_alex_w__	for my large winch backing plates i just paid for my g10 provider to waterjet the circles that i needed
2017-12-12 16:20:42	_alex_w__	for everything else i cut rectangles on a bandsaw or with a hacksaw and just round over the corners abrasively
2017-12-12 16:22:37	@Marcus	I can run mine pretty fast but my saw is really sharp
2017-12-12 16:23:00	C3D2	Marcus: City 'n' county of Brizzle.

2017-12-12 19:06:12	@Dan-NS27	stopped at a Lowe's, mainly because I needed to go to the bathroom. stop by the table saws and an older guy comes up and starts chatting about his time in the army in the 60's. turns out, he's a Ham and was a radio operator in the army too.
2017-12-12 19:06:30	C3D2	Didya make a friend?
2017-12-12 19:06:53	@Dan-NS27	he said he has or is part of a cyber security company nearby. tried offering me a job, or at least contact them to see if or how I could fit in to their company.

2017-12-12 19:17:43	@Dan-NS27	when he mentioned cyber and asked if I did anything with it, I just said I mess with Linux computers, he said they did too.

2017-12-13 12:49:04	C3D2	A lot of people are, I find
2017-12-13 12:50:04	@Dan-NS27	I think BozS has met him and went for a sail with a few others.
2017-12-13 12:51:26	C3D2	Sounds fun.
