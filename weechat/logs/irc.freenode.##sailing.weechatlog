2017-12-07 20:33:26	@_alex_w_	40x bury vs 72x (since they didn't report it that way)
2017-12-07 20:33:50	@_alex_w_	the old recommendation was 64x, i think it changed to 72x so that 64x is still untapered
2017-12-07 20:34:53	Essington	_alex_w_: 64 may be for other HM fibers ...
2017-12-07 20:34:54	@_alex_w_	i often do longer buries instead of carefully measuring
2017-12-07 20:35:01	Essington	I've always used 72 for dyneema ...
2017-12-07 20:35:27	Essington	but it seems that even 48 is stronger than the line itself

2017-12-07 20:38:31	Essington	sometimes
2017-12-07 20:38:39	C3D2	lucky git, I can't
2017-12-07 20:38:54	@_alex_w_	if you find old samson instructions (i can't quickly find them online) they do 3 fid bury lengths, a fid is 21 diameters, so it was 63x
2017-12-07 20:39:02	Essington	C3D2: something about ignorance and bliss ...
2017-12-07 20:39:04	@_alex_w_	now they say 3.5 which is 73.5x
2017-12-07 20:39:27	Essington	fid ...
2017-12-07 20:39:42	@_alex_w_	hey, i'm just saying how samson talks about bury lengths...
2017-12-07 20:39:42	C3D2	Essington: if only, I'm just getting more and more annoyed by a lack of consistent formatting :'(
2017-12-07 20:39:45	@_alex_w_	i don't think in fid lengths
2017-12-07 20:39:47	Essington	I can't be arsed to remember what the hell a fid length is
2017-12-07 20:40:18	Essington	I can remember diameters
2017-12-07 20:40:42	@_alex_w_	and i do a mix of brummel vs simple bury (to takl about theo ther parts of that blog page)
2017-12-07 20:40:51	@_alex_w_	sometimes bury is easier/faster when dealing with hardware
2017-12-07 20:41:19	Essington	I always brummel
2017-12-07 20:41:29	Essington	simply for the security of it all
2017-12-07 20:41:44	@_alex_w_	well, sometimes that isn't possible when you have fixed hardware on both sides
2017-12-07 20:42:05	@_alex_w_	like my traveler line (which is control-dpx, same single braid splices) is a simple bury
2017-12-07 20:42:27	@_alex_w_	if i wanted to brummel i'd have to put a soft or hard shackle in there
2017-12-07 20:42:47	Essington	yeah, I guess that is a case ...
2017-12-07 20:43:09	@_alex_w_	same thing with the backstay on my old boat, which had a thimble in one end and a huge low friction ring at the other
2017-12-07 20:43:19	Essington	even my bronze eyes were able to be brummeled on both ends ...
2017-12-07 20:43:44	@_alex_w_	did you make them a hair oversized and slip the eye in after the splice was finished?

2017-12-07 20:44:55	@_alex_w_	yes, that thimble is too large to be passed through the braid, so at one point did you install it into the splice?
2017-12-07 20:45:01	Essington	nah, stuff a couple of pieces of PVC into the loop and twist them ... it inverts the brummel just enough to slip over the thimble, then you relax and bury
