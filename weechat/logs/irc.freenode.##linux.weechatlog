2017-12-08 18:30:54	Camusensei	I know, and it also does for deleted files

2017-12-08 18:45:14	Dagmar	So right off the bat, one of the problems involved with manipulating the filesystem outsite the fs driver is that you can create desynch between what's in the cache and what's actually on disk
2017-12-08 18:45:28	Dagmar	extundelete at least works within what's possible

2017-12-08 19:19:59	hexnewbie	GivenToCode: I assume the ovl_inodes are in-memory inodes for the overlay filesystems, triggered by e.g. a backup script that crawls the overlays. XFS does something similar (something to do with inode numbers not getting written to disk). I don't know the specifics (can those be freed or not), but unmounting and mounting the overlays will get rid of them temporarily, and crawling can create them

2017-12-08 20:30:39	TRS-80	zesterer: any live version of Linux, you can then resize / create another partition (or attach another drive) rescue your data, etc. but first yes the UEFI/boot is the bigger issue
2017-12-08 20:30:44	Lope	because the 4M blocks will be all over the disk?

2017-12-08 20:33:09	ryouma	so large disks means you can waste space for speed

2017-12-08 20:34:37	TRS-80	zesterer: well, you won't be able to boot into Win if it was set up to run off UEFI, but you should be able to boot into USB install media and partition and install Linux on another partition, then boot into that

2017-12-08 20:37:05	TRS-80	zesterer: you can boot into BIOS butt not OS?
2017-12-08 20:37:13	ryouma	no i am talking about big documents.  better to have the disk swoop them up all at once.
2017-12-08 20:38:03	TRS-80	ryouma they would need to be really really big. usually documents aren't even then, not sure the tradeoff is needed or justified

2017-12-09 13:45:08	mavorsa	though i dont think i would enjoy C-a more than C-b, partly because im just more used to one hand hitting ctrl and the other hitting b, otherwise, i would be twisting my left hand into that weird position everytime i want to do something. lol
2017-12-09 13:45:08	bunnypuncher	you could leave it C-b

2017-12-09 14:17:50	rascul	both are used a bunch, there are no metrics to say that one is used more than another overall
2017-12-09 14:18:16	mawk	who said that
2017-12-09 14:18:16	bunnypuncher	most used by business
2017-12-09 14:18:16	mawk	Debian is a mature choice
2017-12-09 14:18:23	SpiceMan	chamar: rather, check if the dependencies versions you need are provided by the distros
2017-12-09 14:18:37	rascul	generally just use whichever major distro you are most familiar with and best suits your needs
2017-12-09 14:18:42	mawk	at my company me and the guy before me always uses Debian for the production server, you can't think of something more stable than debian
2017-12-09 14:18:55	chamar	SpiceMan, That's the thing.. I have no idea of the workload yet.
2017-12-09 14:19:04	mawk	and if you need support workarounds for every related distro like Ubuntu also work most of the time
2017-12-09 14:19:04	SpiceMan	chamar: or you'll need to install outside the package manager

2017-12-09 14:19:09	SpiceMan	chamar: well, find out then
2017-12-09 14:19:11	bunnypuncher	yep Debian is also solid choice just not as high in market share
2017-12-09 14:19:29	chamar	I was just wondering, at large... if there was one that stand out from the other.
2017-12-09 14:19:37	chamar	seems not.  So I'll roll a dice. ;)
2017-12-09 14:19:42	bunnypuncher	Redhat for large business
2017-12-09 14:19:59	mawk	well centos is popular for small servers because CPanel comes with it, but I personally don't like it much

2017-12-09 14:21:10	chamar	bunnypuncher got a good point.. the upcoming works is govt / financial... so they'll probably stick with RHEL... didn't thought of that
2017-12-09 14:21:14	mawk	if you don't want to subcribe for support that rules out RHEL

2017-12-09 14:21:29	bunnypuncher	not that I like redhat the best or anything
2017-12-09 14:21:41	rascul	if it's goverment work, there might be stipulations on the operating system requirements
2017-12-09 14:21:41	mawk	are you a guy that makes its support alone ? or do you like to call someone else for support
2017-12-09 14:21:54	chamar	I wish mawk ... We are a service provider and most often that not, we use what customer ask for and we make architecture around it.
2017-12-09 14:22:05	mawk	alright

2017-12-09 14:22:30	bunnypuncher	big companies don’t care they will make redhat the standard so their is a party to blame outside the company
2017-12-09 14:23:06	mawk	you should check what kind of package manager you like, also chamar
2017-12-09 14:23:14	mawk	that's one key differentiating features of distros

2017-12-09 14:23:28	mawk	the Debian packaging system is the one used in Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, many others
2017-12-09 14:23:31	mawk	yeah kinda
2017-12-09 14:23:34	mawk	I don't like the packaging system
2017-12-09 14:23:57	rascul	centos is red hat for free
2017-12-09 14:23:58	bunnypuncher	yes centos is pretty much redhat

2017-12-09 14:25:07	mawk	that's why you should pick a comfortable one
2017-12-09 14:25:13	Phanes	yeah the real benefit of rhel over centos is the support contract and the repo access (i think?).  the support contracts are important if you've got mission critical stuff going on and need a blanket for emergencies (which is a good idea)

2017-12-09 14:26:41	chamar	yeah... I guess this is what they would choose (RHEL) .. I'll go that route for now.. the differences are probably not that enormous either and I have a solid Unix background so
2017-12-09 14:26:57	mawk	and you're willing to pay for it chamar ?
2017-12-09 14:27:08	rascul	red hat support > irc

2017-12-09 14:27:35	mawk	lol
2017-12-09 14:27:51	bunnypuncher	right like I said all big companies settle on redhat if you are looking to go to big company learn that.
2017-12-09 14:28:38	Phanes	yeah thats why onsite support engineers should never decide support contracts, their eyes are always bigger than their stomachs when it comes to operationalizing an environment
2017-12-09 14:28:38	bunnypuncher	smaller ones you will see other since they don’t want to pay the needless license and support cost
2017-12-09 14:28:38	Phanes	the difference between a covered client and "well he doesnt work here anymore so we need to cut our losses" is one ego

2017-12-11 14:03:00	pepper_chico	hello, anyone can give me a tip on how to diagnose random full system freeze? I have nothing in default journalctl that points a cause. I thought this was an issue with my SHDD, because it happened, like once a day, in my previous ArchLinux installation, and the SHDD light kept solid red when this happened, and the SHDD was the sole old computer part I had in my setup. I've tried to revert the kernel,
2017-12-11 14:03:02	pepper_chico	microcode, etc, by a mounth or two and it didn't help. I then bought a new SSD, so the PC is a full mostly new machine now, and the experience went well for about two weeks without the same thing happening. I've installed a new minimalist ArchLinux, instead of Gnome on X I'm now using Sway on Wayland, and just essential applications. Yesterday the exact same issue happened for the first time in this new

2017-12-12 11:51:58	EriC^^	what's it doing really? it's copying the iso from my ext hdd, to this laptop's cache? and then when i do sync it copies it to the actual usb? why doesn't it show the mb/s later though?
2017-12-12 11:52:13	EriC^^	ah cause it's an external usb, doh. nevermind
2017-12-12 11:52:16	theraspberry	EriC^^: that is actually a good question, i think its just pending I/O operations but tbh i have nfi
2017-12-12 11:52:29	peetaur2	EriC^^: dd runs...fills up some buffer...exits... the buffer continues to flush and iotop shows nothing
2017-12-12 11:52:35	EriC^^	iotop only shows the os hdd? it wouldnt show writes to an external usb?
2017-12-12 11:52:39	peetaur2	EriC^^: but if you dd conf=fdatasync, then it doesn't exit until the buffer is flushed
2017-12-12 11:52:43	peetaur2	conv*
2017-12-12 11:53:14	peetaur2	iostat will show writes...but iotop is per process, so it won't show it (unless it shows it another way...maybe btrfs and zfs would show a kernel thread still)

2017-12-12 18:35:37	Dagmar	32Mb would have meant a very expensive motherboard, and a sizable investment in RAM
2017-12-12 18:35:46	dTal	it ran Firefox and OpenArena and booted to 64Mb of used ram

2017-12-13 14:36:58	rocky98	Of all the things I hate about IRC in general, the one I hate the most by far are LINUX FANBOYS. Good lord are they a cancer to freenode & the internet in general. Misguiding ppl by saying that switching to linux will be no problem for ANYONE on this planet. They say wine can actually run windows programs in a pragmatic manner. Not mentioning any of the drawbacks of linux like terrible driver support. And what happens
2017-12-13 14:36:58	rocky98	when you tell them about a limitation of linux? They will condemn you, insult you with Ad-hominem attacks & try to make you look really stupid for even wanting that feature which is NOT available in linux. For eg, I once went to that IRC server that's default on linux mint hex chat & told them that there is a Windows program that allows me to replace lock screen password with a totp code, so there is no chance of
2017-12-13 14:36:58	rocky98	anyone knowing my password(which is also my outlook account password) by watching me type & asked if there is a linux alternative.  What reply do it get? Without knowing anything,  person told, "If you are sitting in front of your computer when your friends are around, you have bigger problems to deal with". So I thought maybe I'm just unfortunate that an ass replied to me, so I went to ##linux on freenode & said the
2017-12-13 14:36:58	rocky98	same thing. What reply do it get? "You must type idiotically slow & have a really simple password for someone to know your password by watching you type". Good lord, is it impossible for someone to not see the alphabets I type even if I did that really fast? It is a security vulnerability that I didn't wish to take. No solutions, just ad hominem attacks. Next day, I told them that linux asking me for my password every
2017-12-13 14:36:58	rocky98	time I installed a program is just stupid, because if I didn't want others to install programs, I would give him a user account like Windows has. Asking me for a password to do things  when I've entered the password to login to the OS is just plain stupid and gives no additional security. Again an idiotic response comes in where some guy mentions security vulnerabilities of Windows, even though that has nothing to do

Simply create the device as a LUKS device, open it, do "dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/crypt_dev bs=500M" then once it's done close it, then create once more. Feeding zero's into the encryption algorithm generates the random data .

2017-12-14 02:30:32	Dagmar	jaysusplaysuz: Now if you have the firewall set to *reject* packets from strangers, but if you have it set to *drop* them, that's another thing.  Does the same thing happen when you telnet to say, port 26 or 80 (assuming there's no webserver)

2017-12-14 05:10:51	roadhazard	For raid5 especially it is NOT safe to skip the initial sync. The raid5 implementation optimises use of the component disks and it is possible for all updates to be "read-modify-write" updates which assume the parity is correct. If it is wrong, it stays wrong. Then when you lose a drive, the parity blocks are wrong so the data you recover using them is wrong. In other words - you will get data corruption.

2017-12-14 05:39:01	Dagmar	So long as it _knows_ it has to basically rebuild the array, writing to it is just going to mean it'll be sure to write the new data correctly

Then I symlink specific things (like /home/user/Downloads/, and my music) to be on the HDD because I don't need the speed for that. I suggest putting both operating systems on the SSD and then anything that is big or you don't need to access with speed (I think anything that isn't software or part of the OS), on the

2017-12-14 11:52:00	sud0x3	truepurple: its a secure delete tool the whole point is to delete files and folders securely, did you see options or mention anywhere in the man page or help text to suggest that folders or files may not be secureley deleted i didnt
2017-12-14 11:52:20	djph	ananke: I think we ended up telling him to nuke it from orbit - it's the only way to be sure.
2017-12-14 11:52:48	sud0x3	and i stil think users like yourself put your ssyetm in more danger from lack of understanding and messing about than just running with a distro out the box

2017-12-14 11:53:04	truepurple	Ok, you two have made some good points. Though you haven't been fair/accurate in other regards and I do notice people spending so much time to lecture me when a simple  yes/no would suffice sometimes

2017-12-14 11:53:27	djph	sud0x3: only concern I have with it is what assumptions it makes about "where is the file" -- because if like `shred', it assumes that it's not on a modern fs, we're back to the "hmm, you could leave traces in the journal"

2017-12-14 11:54:13	truepurple	djph: Traces are different than how others made it sound with full copies of files in journals
2017-12-14 11:54:13	ananke	truepurple: and the point of the lecture is for you to understand why there is no simple yes/no, and to point out your obnoxious laziness

2017-12-14 13:41:02	triceratux	sud0x3: yep lubuntu-next was issuing nightlies thru the 17.10 release. they did not release an official image. its pretty excellent tho & so is the extonos based on it http://www.extix.se/?p=332
2017-12-14 13:41:22	sud0x3	BluesKaj: Like everything in linux though you can change that, i mean in gnome 3 themes can be specified in css i believe. From the variation of the few themes i have tried with gnome 3 i just cant say the look would put me off, usuability, workflow wise its usuless for me but makig it look nice i dont see that being a major hurdle.

2017-12-14 13:45:28	sud0x3	BluesKaj: True that like i said i dont even use a DE i use a tiling window manager, rarely ever see the desktop use shortcuts to launch most applications clock at the top of the screen and thats it. I havent used kde for years, probably the only linux desktop id struggle to find setting but i hear the search is great on kde for the options

2017-12-14 13:46:44	Dan39	just got another dell r330 bladeserver. of course every one they send ends up being a little different. this one has a perc s130 raid controller. i configure the virtual disk to raid 1 the 2 physical disks and then boot up centos or ubuntu on a usb, but it just shows the 2 physical disks. what is going on here?

2017-12-14 20:25:51	rockdarko	Hi guys, I was wondering what VNC server you guys prefered and why? I just migrated all my Desktops to Manjaro from Ubuntu where I was using RealVNC and as much as I realize it's available through AUR, I'd like to use something open-source if possible. I know about x11vnc and am familiar with it, and I've tested tigervnc which is fine but a little bit glitchy.

2017-12-14 23:48:58	nerrollus	So if you're running jobs that require a ton of processor power, is it worth setting one up to speed things up?

2017-12-15 01:06:23	maestrojed	I am having the hardest time with directory and files permissions, etc. My linux install is a vagrant box. These files are in the a folder shared with VirtualBox. I realize that is probably part of the issue. I still hope for a solution.
2017-12-15 01:06:29	maestrojed	I have a folder for apache to save stuff in. It has permission 0777, and is owned and grouped vagrant:vagrant. Apache is configured to run as the user/group vagrant:vagrant. When apache creates a new directory it is given permissions 0744. I have set umask down to 0000. No difference.
2017-12-15 01:06:50	maestrojed	When apache tries to write into that new directory it is denied permission.  If I "chmod 0777 newDirectory/" I don't get an error, but the permissions do not update. Even if the permissions are 744 I should still be able to write, vagrant is the owner. Something odd is happening.

2017-12-15 01:19:32	maestrojed	What makes you say that? It might be a pointer.
2017-12-15 01:19:43	Dagmar	Either way the sane thing to do is go back to the documentation for setting up vagrant and double-checking everything
2017-12-15 01:19:53	Dagmar	Pointer?  What kind of pointer?
2017-12-15 01:20:05	maestrojed	Everything is running great except the scripts can't create files in directories its created. It can create files in directories that already exist. etc.
2017-12-15 01:20:13	jimm	maestrojed, perhaps that's the packagename?
2017-12-15 01:20:54	Dagmar	So what's the difference in ownership and permissions between the directories it has created and the directories that already existed

2017-12-15 01:22:01	Dagmar	It can do that
2017-12-15 01:22:04	jimm	maestrojed, apache is particular about the permissions of the various files and dirs that it uses
2017-12-15 01:22:17	Dagmar	"nobody" is a common role user for running scripts on a webserver

2017-12-15 02:37:39	mutante	Dagmar: the real fix is to get ALL the tags from MusicBrainz and if you have CDs that are "underground" enough to not be listed to edit MusicBrainz and add them yourself and then just let the tagger run again :)

2017-12-15 04:18:37	Dagmar	banisterfiend: Nope
2017-12-15 04:18:38	banisterfiend	how does it know whether to use stdin as the arglist or whether to use stdin the way it uses in when reading from a pipe

2017-12-15 04:35:23	Johnjay_	i have a ubuntu install where x randomly crashes and i don't have the expertise to diagnose it
2017-12-15 04:35:31	Johnjay_	i.e. what might lead to it crashing
2017-12-15 04:35:33	Dagmar	Buzzlewo_: It's a shortened version of logical volume scan

2017-12-15 04:36:08	Buzzlewo_	that sounds right to my memory
2017-12-15 04:36:20	jimm	skypce, you can do that... but first, what is the exact problem? what did you try, for each, what was the result and what did you expect?
2017-12-15 04:36:21	Johnjay_	bunnypuncher: i'm aware of that. that's not what i asked
2017-12-15 04:36:23	Buzzlewo_	but I hvae 2 drives in the machine
2017-12-15 04:36:40	Dagmar	Buzzlewo_: Excellent.  We need to mount the root one, so... `mount /dev/mapper/ubuntu-vg--root /mnt`.  You can basically start smacking the tab key after getting half that filename out
2017-12-15 04:37:04	Dagmar	Buzzlewo_: Are you familiar with vi or any command-line text editor?
2017-12-15 04:37:05	jimm	maybe the vg isn't active... maybe the pvs aren't accessable

2017-12-15 04:38:38	Buzzlewo_	ok dagmar..sez:  special device /dev/mapper/ubuntu-vg--root does not exist
2017-12-15 04:39:00	Dagmar	Buzzlewo_: But basically, we'll be mounting the / filesystem under /mnt, and then you'll jsut edit /mnt/etc/lvm/lvm.conf and change the line about lvmetad to have a zero at the end, save the file, do `umount /mnt` to safely unmount it, and then try booting again

2017-12-15 08:33:51	bunnypuncher	yes but to a programmer from another language or some new then the rules and syntax is a bit odd
2017-12-15 08:33:59	bunnypuncher	it becomes clear with use
2017-12-15 08:34:25	pingfloyd	that's because a shell isn't a general purpose language but has more of a distinct purpose
2017-12-15 08:34:38	jack_rabbit	max12345, i.e. echo somefile.txt | sed 's/foo/bar/' -> execute command 'echo' with argument 'somefile.txt' and pipe the output to the command 'sed' with the argument 's/foo/bar/'.

2017-12-15 14:07:01	ssarah	it means there is a service on the network that attributes IPs to machines connected to that network
2017-12-15 14:07:11	djph	sud0x3: pretty much (or, the UK equivalent, in your case)

2017-12-15 14:08:37	djph	ssarah: if you have a DHCP server on the network, your PC will be automatically assigned one.  If you want to assign a *static* IP address, then it depends slightly on whether you're using a Debian-based distro (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, many others), or Red Hat (Fedora, CentOS, many others)

2017-12-15 14:55:36	drake01	Hi, I was trying to show a young friend how to go through the linux source, configure linux kernel, compile. But when I tried to teach structs (skbuff etc. ) it became boring, and I start feeling useless. Is there a way to teach the source in a good way?
2017-12-15 14:56:02	TJ-	strixdio: probably need to set the baud rate for the line, possibly 9600 ?

2017-12-15 17:01:09	hdon__	hm. according to one SO post: "LVM-RAID is actually mdraid under the covers. It basically works by creating two logical volumes per RAID device (one for data, called "rimage"; one for metadata, called "rmeta"). It then passes those off to the existing mdraid drivers."

2017-12-18 11:34:51	xryuu	anyone using GPU Passthrough? How many GPU's are you using? What's the performance(software/game+fps)
2017-12-18 11:34:54	ren0v0	And from logrotate man:   Log files are rotated every hour. Note that usually logrotate is configured to be run by cron daily. You have to change this configuration and run logrotate hourly to be able to really rotate logs hourly.
2017-12-18 11:35:01	Ben64	i guess a 3 year old stackoverflow topic isn't the gospel
2017-12-18 11:35:01	ren0v0	So, where are you seeing this shouldn't be done?

2017-12-18 18:29:52	Cooler	abkinch, raw sockets? its sending a ICMP protocol echo message
2017-12-18 18:30:00	Cooler	thats part of the standard
2017-12-18 18:30:01	abkinch	So, back to your example, you could copy the contents of the ping command and make a new binary, but you couldn't make it setuid root, so it wouldn't work.

2017-12-18 22:28:01	sammm	hey, my thinkpad x121e running fedora 27 reports the bluetooth interface is off via hardware. this is a known bug with the laptop, it works fine in WIN... is there a way I can get it to turn on (even though it is)?
2017-12-18 22:28:02	djph	Dagmar: it's not really "backwards", I mean they do have a switch  onboard ...
2017-12-18 22:28:26	Dagmar	djph: It's "backwards" in that they were designed using the assumption that WAN is going to be upstream
2017-12-18 22:28:27	djph	Dagmar: or do you mean in terms of "it acts as a station instead of an AP?"
2017-12-18 22:28:47	Dagmar	If it's not what I said then it's probably not what I meant either

2017-12-19 11:31:24	djph	actually, you don't read "word-to-word".  Sure, if you're a slow reader you will (or if you're reading a textbook), but most people "read" in a manner more akin to skimming, understanding the whole thing, but really only focusing on every 'nth' word.  Same idea behind why the order of the letters doesn't matter for you to understand words.

2017-12-19 12:06:10	rouji	that was one of your complaints
2017-12-19 12:08:39	kvik	Woodpecker, I understand your points but I feel those things can be handled better and with better long term results than your brute force method. you could e.g. publish a TTS reader config for reading wikipedia, try to improve OSS TTS readers, help improve accessibility features of wikipedia articles themselves, etc.
2017-12-19 12:09:14	Woodpecker	kvik: There is a problem with that suggestion too; licensing.
2017-12-19 12:09:48	jim	mentalita, that's basically the same thing..., when in python, you open a file with b, you're specifying how it is to treat the data it reads (aka how to interpret it)

2017-12-19 12:12:02	Woodpecker	kvik: Its almost nearly impossible to create even an application using tts in this manner which did not incur a subscription fee of per use fee.
2017-12-19 12:12:07	jim	mentalita, and, whether to "execute" the files contents as a program, that's also a specification of how to interpret tyhe data
2017-12-19 12:12:11	kvik	Woodpecker, I see, I don't really use TTS software so I wouldn't know the current state of it but this sounds really nasty and horrible. that's one more reason to try and improve OSS alternatives then

2017-12-19 12:45:27	bls	do you really want 2factor auth ir not?
2017-12-19 12:45:45	jhodrien	IMO, 2FA with your own auth server has some appeal above what just ssh keys provide.
2017-12-19 12:45:55	rouji	jhodrien: it does
2017-12-19 12:46:08	sruli	i have an issue with logrotate, i set "size=5M" and when i run logrotate -vdf /etc/logrotate.d/maillog i get "log needs rotating" it does not specify reason however logfile is only 144K in size, when i set "minsize=5M" i get "only log files >= 5242880 bytes are rotated" and again "log needs rotating" without a reason, any ideas why it wants to rtotate before reaching the set size? (i have not set daily, weekly etc..)
2017-12-19 12:46:11	rouji	in our case probably not worth the hassle though
2017-12-19 12:46:25	jhodrien	rouji: Sure, it's by no means universally worth it.

2017-12-19 14:26:20	mentalita	cool
2017-12-19 14:26:41	jim	specifically, shell 1 (with its PATH) calls the script which changes PATH, so: it calls a new shell, changes the new shell's PATH, then exits
2017-12-19 14:26:43	triceratux	https://zlib.net/pigz/
2017-12-19 14:26:53	jhodrien	So don't do gzip *;
2017-12-19 14:27:14	jhodrien	If you do a loop and background them, you can go as parallel as you like without pigz.
2017-12-19 14:27:20	peetaur2	gpunk missed the most important part... the &     for i in *; do gzip "$i" & done
2017-12-19 14:27:26	mentalita	is that why you do 'export'?

This was around 16 hours ago, and mount.ntfs was at 100%, so I stopped the "cp" command and mount.ntfs is still at 100% after 1 hour, still very slowly writing at 100-500kB/s, what does this mean and how do I kill it without breaking the filesystem?

2017-12-19 14:32:51	kaos	stannaz: the ntfs fs driver is not super-awesomely and suitable for real production, so shit like that might happen. however, killing cp should be okay, i think. it should not damage the fs to kill cp, i think.

2017-12-19 15:01:42	Ormu	I'd like to use Grub hdparm module to configure HDD power management before booting Windows. So I tried "hdparm -B 254 hd0" but it says "not an ATA device". I also tried "hdparm -B 254 ahci0" but such device is not found. I found this: https://www.unixadm.org/needful-things/ataunlock   and it tells how to workaround if the disk is in AHCI mode but Grub is not. I tried to run "nativedisk" command
2017-12-19 15:01:56	Ormu	but it causes Grub to hang. So is there any other solution?

2017-12-19 17:14:16	jim	mentalita, octal is a number base that has the property that powers of 2 are easier to express and read... so, a segment of memory dumped in octal could be easy to read

2017-12-19 17:16:02	ananke	mentalita: otherwise your question requires context
2017-12-19 17:16:08	Ormu	octal dump is raw data expressed in octal format (base-8)
2017-12-19 17:16:36	mentalita	ok I see
2017-12-19 17:17:09	Ormu	(are there any practical applications for octal dumps?)
2017-12-19 17:17:18	ananke	octal is nice in some cases where you operate on 4 bit chunks, registers, etc
2017-12-19 17:17:25	Ormu	hm yeah
2017-12-19 17:17:37	Ormu	some exotic systems even define "byte" as 4 bits?

2017-12-19 22:07:59	phogg	freelancerbob: for interactive users (UID >= 1000) it is quite common for distributions to configure it so that by default the user has a group with the same name and files created by that user are also in that group

2017-12-19 22:08:48	phogg	freelancerbob: If your distribution follows that convention then you will see that, yes. But it's not necessarily going to be that way on every Linux system.
2017-12-19 22:08:48	TJ-	BlackMage: that's USB controller, where the device is connected most likely. You might need to play with the path traversing with less of the ../.. parts

Adding 'mary' to group 'bob' may allow Mary to read Bob's files, and Mary to  run processes under 'bob' whenever she likes. She won't be able to do that under user 'bob', so the group is completely distinct entity from the user.

2017-12-20 17:48:50	Tadgy	seeseemelk: I don't think version.h is created until you run make - so you'd likely have to configure the kernel build, and then build it before you find a version.h in the source.  That is, if it /does/ actually create one.

Apart having the dynamic libraries installed (and maybe having the linker properly configured to find those?), is it directly supported by Linux?  Thanks for your help.

2017-12-20 19:41:57	Exagone313	I'm asking for how it works
2017-12-20 19:41:59	Exagone313	I mean
2017-12-20 19:42:18	Exagone313	I know the distro has to provide the dynamic libraries as I said
2017-12-20 19:42:26	hexnewbie	Debian (and perhaps Ubuntu, and other distros) have gone to putting all the libraries in /lib/<arch> so that 64 bit libs go into /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ , and 32 bit libs go into /lib/i386-linux-gnu/
2017-12-20 19:42:35	abkinch	There are two things needed.  The libs, and kernel support.
2017-12-20 19:43:07	Exagone313	so if I'm compiling Linux, it's going to be enabled by default (or maybe with a flag)?
2017-12-20 19:44:09	hexnewbie	Although kernel and processor support is not 100% required in all cases, as Debian's multiarch allows you to install armhf packages on x86 and run them with qemu user emulation (according to documentation, haven't actually tried it)
2017-12-20 19:44:34	bls	also note that most x86_64 processors have legacy modes since the 32 bit instruction set is pretty close to a subset of the 64 bit one

There's an option for 64 bit support, and one for X32 (which is something else). The i386 32 bit syscalls and support should be always enabled (unless some cleanup work in the future decides they should be disableable)

2017-12-20 20:51:22	pppingme	literall add "DNS1=x.x.x.x" to set one manually in ifcfg-* or (I think, need to check) "NOPEERDNS" to ignore dhcp or ppp set servers

2017-12-20 21:25:08	doublehp	Jester01: mplayer tv:///3 works almost fine, with a few conditions: command always outputs the used input: "Current input: 2", but, the input given as argument is not used immediately; i need to run the command TWICE; it always uses the argument from the previous run
2017-12-20 21:25:35	doublehp	Jester01: it's a known bug of TV hardware; I remember I had this issue 16 years ago with PCI cards
2017-12-20 21:26:41	doublehp	Jester01: so, I have to run mplayer tv:///0 twice to have mplayer report it will be using 0 instead of 2. But, even after launching it 4 times on channel 4, it will stick to "2". so, it does not crash, but console output reports coherent things.
2017-12-20 21:26:58	Jester01	you can also set input using v4lctrl
