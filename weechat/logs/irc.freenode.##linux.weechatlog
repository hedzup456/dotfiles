2017-12-08 18:30:54	Camusensei	I know, and it also does for deleted files

2017-12-08 18:45:14	Dagmar	So right off the bat, one of the problems involved with manipulating the filesystem outsite the fs driver is that you can create desynch between what's in the cache and what's actually on disk
2017-12-08 18:45:28	Dagmar	extundelete at least works within what's possible

2017-12-08 19:19:59	hexnewbie	GivenToCode: I assume the ovl_inodes are in-memory inodes for the overlay filesystems, triggered by e.g. a backup script that crawls the overlays. XFS does something similar (something to do with inode numbers not getting written to disk). I don't know the specifics (can those be freed or not), but unmounting and mounting the overlays will get rid of them temporarily, and crawling can create them

2017-12-08 20:30:39	TRS-80	zesterer: any live version of Linux, you can then resize / create another partition (or attach another drive) rescue your data, etc. but first yes the UEFI/boot is the bigger issue
2017-12-08 20:30:44	Lope	because the 4M blocks will be all over the disk?

2017-12-08 20:33:09	ryouma	so large disks means you can waste space for speed

2017-12-08 20:34:37	TRS-80	zesterer: well, you won't be able to boot into Win if it was set up to run off UEFI, but you should be able to boot into USB install media and partition and install Linux on another partition, then boot into that

2017-12-08 20:37:05	TRS-80	zesterer: you can boot into BIOS butt not OS?
2017-12-08 20:37:13	ryouma	no i am talking about big documents.  better to have the disk swoop them up all at once.
2017-12-08 20:38:03	TRS-80	ryouma they would need to be really really big. usually documents aren't even then, not sure the tradeoff is needed or justified

2017-12-09 13:45:08	mavorsa	though i dont think i would enjoy C-a more than C-b, partly because im just more used to one hand hitting ctrl and the other hitting b, otherwise, i would be twisting my left hand into that weird position everytime i want to do something. lol
2017-12-09 13:45:08	bunnypuncher	you could leave it C-b

2017-12-09 14:17:50	rascul	both are used a bunch, there are no metrics to say that one is used more than another overall
2017-12-09 14:18:16	mawk	who said that
2017-12-09 14:18:16	bunnypuncher	most used by business
2017-12-09 14:18:16	mawk	Debian is a mature choice
2017-12-09 14:18:23	SpiceMan	chamar: rather, check if the dependencies versions you need are provided by the distros
2017-12-09 14:18:37	rascul	generally just use whichever major distro you are most familiar with and best suits your needs
2017-12-09 14:18:42	mawk	at my company me and the guy before me always uses Debian for the production server, you can't think of something more stable than debian
2017-12-09 14:18:55	chamar	SpiceMan, That's the thing.. I have no idea of the workload yet.
2017-12-09 14:19:04	mawk	and if you need support workarounds for every related distro like Ubuntu also work most of the time
2017-12-09 14:19:04	SpiceMan	chamar: or you'll need to install outside the package manager

2017-12-09 14:19:09	SpiceMan	chamar: well, find out then
2017-12-09 14:19:11	bunnypuncher	yep Debian is also solid choice just not as high in market share
2017-12-09 14:19:29	chamar	I was just wondering, at large... if there was one that stand out from the other.
2017-12-09 14:19:37	chamar	seems not.  So I'll roll a dice. ;)
2017-12-09 14:19:42	bunnypuncher	Redhat for large business
2017-12-09 14:19:59	mawk	well centos is popular for small servers because CPanel comes with it, but I personally don't like it much

2017-12-09 14:21:10	chamar	bunnypuncher got a good point.. the upcoming works is govt / financial... so they'll probably stick with RHEL... didn't thought of that
2017-12-09 14:21:14	mawk	if you don't want to subcribe for support that rules out RHEL

2017-12-09 14:21:29	bunnypuncher	not that I like redhat the best or anything
2017-12-09 14:21:41	rascul	if it's goverment work, there might be stipulations on the operating system requirements
2017-12-09 14:21:41	mawk	are you a guy that makes its support alone ? or do you like to call someone else for support
2017-12-09 14:21:54	chamar	I wish mawk ... We are a service provider and most often that not, we use what customer ask for and we make architecture around it.
2017-12-09 14:22:05	mawk	alright

2017-12-09 14:22:30	bunnypuncher	big companies don’t care they will make redhat the standard so their is a party to blame outside the company
2017-12-09 14:23:06	mawk	you should check what kind of package manager you like, also chamar
2017-12-09 14:23:14	mawk	that's one key differentiating features of distros

2017-12-09 14:23:28	mawk	the Debian packaging system is the one used in Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, many others
2017-12-09 14:23:31	mawk	yeah kinda
2017-12-09 14:23:34	mawk	I don't like the packaging system
2017-12-09 14:23:57	rascul	centos is red hat for free
2017-12-09 14:23:58	bunnypuncher	yes centos is pretty much redhat

2017-12-09 14:25:07	mawk	that's why you should pick a comfortable one
2017-12-09 14:25:13	Phanes	yeah the real benefit of rhel over centos is the support contract and the repo access (i think?).  the support contracts are important if you've got mission critical stuff going on and need a blanket for emergencies (which is a good idea)

2017-12-09 14:26:41	chamar	yeah... I guess this is what they would choose (RHEL) .. I'll go that route for now.. the differences are probably not that enormous either and I have a solid Unix background so
2017-12-09 14:26:57	mawk	and you're willing to pay for it chamar ?
2017-12-09 14:27:08	rascul	red hat support > irc

2017-12-09 14:27:35	mawk	lol
2017-12-09 14:27:51	bunnypuncher	right like I said all big companies settle on redhat if you are looking to go to big company learn that.
2017-12-09 14:28:38	Phanes	yeah thats why onsite support engineers should never decide support contracts, their eyes are always bigger than their stomachs when it comes to operationalizing an environment
2017-12-09 14:28:38	bunnypuncher	smaller ones you will see other since they don’t want to pay the needless license and support cost
2017-12-09 14:28:38	Phanes	the difference between a covered client and "well he doesnt work here anymore so we need to cut our losses" is one ego

2017-12-11 14:03:00	pepper_chico	hello, anyone can give me a tip on how to diagnose random full system freeze? I have nothing in default journalctl that points a cause. I thought this was an issue with my SHDD, because it happened, like once a day, in my previous ArchLinux installation, and the SHDD light kept solid red when this happened, and the SHDD was the sole old computer part I had in my setup. I've tried to revert the kernel,
2017-12-11 14:03:02	pepper_chico	microcode, etc, by a mounth or two and it didn't help. I then bought a new SSD, so the PC is a full mostly new machine now, and the experience went well for about two weeks without the same thing happening. I've installed a new minimalist ArchLinux, instead of Gnome on X I'm now using Sway on Wayland, and just essential applications. Yesterday the exact same issue happened for the first time in this new

2017-12-12 11:51:58	EriC^^	what's it doing really? it's copying the iso from my ext hdd, to this laptop's cache? and then when i do sync it copies it to the actual usb? why doesn't it show the mb/s later though?
2017-12-12 11:52:13	EriC^^	ah cause it's an external usb, doh. nevermind
2017-12-12 11:52:16	theraspberry	EriC^^: that is actually a good question, i think its just pending I/O operations but tbh i have nfi
2017-12-12 11:52:29	peetaur2	EriC^^: dd runs...fills up some buffer...exits... the buffer continues to flush and iotop shows nothing
2017-12-12 11:52:35	EriC^^	iotop only shows the os hdd? it wouldnt show writes to an external usb?
2017-12-12 11:52:39	peetaur2	EriC^^: but if you dd conf=fdatasync, then it doesn't exit until the buffer is flushed
2017-12-12 11:52:43	peetaur2	conv*
2017-12-12 11:53:14	peetaur2	iostat will show writes...but iotop is per process, so it won't show it (unless it shows it another way...maybe btrfs and zfs would show a kernel thread still)

2017-12-12 18:35:37	Dagmar	32Mb would have meant a very expensive motherboard, and a sizable investment in RAM
2017-12-12 18:35:46	dTal	it ran Firefox and OpenArena and booted to 64Mb of used ram
